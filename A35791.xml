         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE famous <hi>Ovid,</hi> whoſe matchleſs Charms had render'd the Grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Univerſe jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, as well of his Honor, as in his Amours, was ſent into the Iſle of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſia,</hi> to expiate a Crime, they had only made him guilty of. He much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the Court, and its delights: And a Baniſhment
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94435:3"/> was more cruel and inſupportable to a perſon of his temper, than it would have been to any other of a more reſerv'd converſe. He vented his reſentments in the deepeſt complaints, and moſt extravagant ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, his Soul was capable to expreſs; and with a motion, whereby he would ſeem to meaſure the length of his misfortunes, haſtily plung'd himſelf into a thick Wood, which border'd upon the Coaſt, that reſpects <hi>Macedonia:</hi> when paſſing by a place, which Nature had ſeem'd to have taken pleaſure to make the ſeat of a vernant Palace, he caſt a careleſs glance upon a Cloth, diſorderly ſpread on a fragrant Bed of Camomile, which look't as if with a negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent curioſity it had been embroider'd over with ſcatter'd flowers, fruits, empty diſhes, and many other ruines of a noble Treat. He caſt a quick eye round about him, to ſee if amongſt the Trees he could retrieve ſome perſon, or other, that might give him an account of ſo unexpected an Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. At length he diſcover'd two Women of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent feature; who ruſhing ſuddenly into the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt coverts of thoſe Woods, made themſelves a Skreen, to rob their Beauties as well from the eyes of <hi>Tytan,</hi> as his, of ſome Thickets, which Nature ſeem'd with the interwoven branches of ſweet bloſſoming Thorns and wild Roſes to have form'd for a withdrawing Room to the other, from whence the unſeen Gueſts, had a little before departed. He made a ſign to his Eſquire, and two Slaves (who compos'd the whole Retinue of his Exile) not to follow him; and eagerly purſuing the fair Fugitives, he prepar'd himſelf to ſpeak ſomething of gallantry to them upon the firſt encounter, Fortune had ſo kindly offer'd him; when he thought his own name reſounded in his ear: He made a halt; and lending
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94435:3"/> a more diligent attention, he heard one of them, ſay to the other, How is it poſſible that a Paſſion ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſhould be ſo deeply engrafted in a heart, for a Perſon, whom one never ſaw? I underſtand well enough, that the ſight of an object, which gives a kind of pleaſing titillation to the ſenſes, paſſes from thence into the cabinet of our hearts; and there creates that agreeable diſtemper, which the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or ſympathy of humor, converts into Love; But upon the bare character, one receives either of the gayety of, wit, or converſe of an unknown, that one ſhould nouriſh ſuch deſires, careſs ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet Gueſt within their breaſts; in a word, Love with ſuch violence, as you love <hi>Ovid,</hi> is that, which never yet ſignaliz'd any of your Sex, but your ſelf; and what Poſterity will chronicle amongſt her fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous miracles, if ſhe ſhall have the honor to write your Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>I do not fear that treachery on your part, reply'd the Lady, to whom this diſcourſe was addreſt, though you are the onely perſon capable to effect it; ſince you are the onely perſon in the world, to whom I have unboſom'd the ſecrets of my heart. But, my dear one, if this misfortune ſhould arrive me, I hope, the ſame Poſterity, that ſhall be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my name, will not likewiſe be ignorant of that of <hi>Ovid;</hi> and in expoſing to the view of the world my weakneſs for that great Perſonage, it will likewiſe, at the ſame time, convince it of my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. It is not the beauty of his Perſon that charms me; but thoſe more powerful charms of his wit, which never yet any female ones could boaſt they were proof againſt. When I read thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate expreſſions in his Elegies, wherein he ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally delineates to our fancies the various charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94435:4"/> of Love, with the divine Pencil of his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Muſe, I am ſurpriz'd with a ſudden emotion of delight, that inflames me with a moſt impatient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſeeing that more admirable Perſon, to whom I owe it. I cannot forbear, methinks, to intereſt my ſelf in all his Concerns, in gratitude to thoſe agreeable Tranſpotts, his Verſes inſpire into my Soul: And as often as I make a reflection upon that felicity, which might have bleſt theſe eyes with ſo noble an object, as <hi>Ovid,</hi> in the Court of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> had Fortune treated me with leſs rigor, I heap as many imprecations upon her for this one circumſtance of my misfortune, as for that obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein ſhe forces me to linger out the inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous remnant of a vagabond life.</p>
               <p>This is call d, my ſweet one, reply'd the other, interrupting her, a Love not of <hi>Ovid,</hi> but of his Verſes, ſince you have yet ſeen no other part of him; but ſhould Fortune, to regain your good opinion, preſent you together with the magick of his enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Muſe, a ſight of his Perſon, you would then become more enamor'd of the Author, than you are now of his Works. <hi>Ovid</hi>'s attention was ſo fixt to the diſcourſe of thoſe Women, that he was not ſenſible of the noiſe, which two men made in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by him; who had the leiſure to entertain him, as well in their embraces, as their knowledge, before he came to his own. Their careſſes reduc'd him out of his extaſie, and preſented to his admiration <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Lentulus,</hi> whoſe renowned Victories over the <hi>Scythians,</hi> and <hi>Dacians,</hi> had purchas'd him the fame of one of the greateſt Captains in the world; and <hi>Hortenſius Hortalus,</hi> the onely ſurviving branch of the illuſtrious Race of the <hi>Hortenſius</hi>'s. But <hi>Ovid</hi>'s ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize was not ſo great, at the encounter of him,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94435:4"/> (whom he knew <hi>Caeſar</hi> had ſome three, or four years before baniſh't into <hi>Thalaſſia,</hi> for having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to receive an eminent Command, and a fair Wife from his hands,) as of <hi>Lentulus;</hi> who, he thought had been at the head of thoſe Troops, which the Emperor had ſent forth to chaſtiſe the late Revolt of the <hi>Getes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Have the Rebels, ſaid he to <hi>Lentulus,</hi> tamely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted their obedience to your all-conquering fame? And your redoubted Name, and the memory of thoſe ſplendid Actions, you perform'd once before in the reduction of thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> diſarm'd them of their natural fierceneſs and courage? Or has <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> ſo unworthily forgotten himſelf, as to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the glorious ſervices of <hi>Lentulus,</hi> with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Baniſhment? The <hi>Getes,</hi> reply'd <hi>Lentulus,</hi> continue obſtinate, and with a ſtiff neck refuſe to receive again the yoke of their duty; And if <hi>Caeſar</hi> has unworthily recompenc'd the zeal, I have ever had for his intereſts and glory, it is not now by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining me to this barbarous Climate; but a motive, no leſs powerful, than that of his Commands, has call d me hither; from whence it muſt be a greater, than the obedience I owe them, that can recall me. This is a myſtery, I ſhall declare to you at more lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: In the mean time let us underſtand what ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Fate has hurry'd you hither, to breathe this inhumane air: for if you believe that <hi>Caeſar</hi> has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten both himſelf and his honor, in confining me to it, I muſt judge, that he is guilty of a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, in treating the renowned <hi>Ovid</hi> with ſo much cruelty.</p>
               <p>The arrival of the two Ladies, who came forth of their flowry Cabinet, prevented <hi>Ovid</hi> from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning an anſwer: They heard ſome perſons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94435:5"/> not far from them, and they came to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves, who they were. <hi>Ovid</hi> ask't <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> the names, and quality of thoſe Ladies; who told him, that one of them was named <hi>Junia,</hi> daughter to the Triumvir <hi>Lepidus;</hi> and the other, ſaid <hi>Lentulus</hi> interrupting him, calls herſelf <hi>Roſeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and makes a moſt inviolable ſecret both of her Birth and her Fortune: She ſpeaks two or three Languages with that natural grace and eloquence, that no Man can judge, which of them is her native Tongue. But by the ſweetneſs of her temper, and the gentile air of her deportment, I judge her to be of <hi>Roman</hi> extraction. Whether it were the beauty of this fair Stranger, that on the firſt proſpect made a deeper impreſſion in the ſoft breaſt of the amorous <hi>Ovid,</hi> than that of <hi>Junia,</hi> (over which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the other could challenge no ſuperiority) or that he thought, he diſcover'd, in the eyes of <hi>Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> ſomething which ſeem'd more ally'd to the blind paſſion, he underſtood one of them had for him, than in the ſevere and majeſtick garb of the daughter of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> he ſent a thouſand ſilent wiſhes to Heaven, that <hi>Roſelina</hi> might be that ſecret Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuſe, he heard them diſcourſe of. He could not rectifie himſelf in his hopes by the knowledge of their voices; he had been ſo ſhort a time their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, that he could not diſtinguiſh them; and as they treated of private affairs, they ſpoke not ſo loud, as to tune them in their natural key. The different proceedings of theſe two Ladies confirm'd his ſuſpition. <hi>Junia</hi> remain'd not long in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Ovid,</hi> after they had acquainted him with their names; But <hi>Roſelina</hi> on the other ſide, ſeem'd fixt, as it were, by a ſecret charm, to the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe three <hi>Romans:</hi> each action of hers was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94435:5"/> paſſionate, and her eyes expreſt a trouble and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which <hi>Ovid</hi> had in his Works preſented the World too lively a draught of, to be ignorant of the character. He had ſcarce time to make his full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark on this Subject; for <hi>Junia</hi> having proclaim'd the arrival of this illuſtrious Man to all ſhe met, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd him to turn from <hi>Roſelina,</hi> to repay the Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and generous Careſſes of all the eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who at that time did with their Reſidence il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the Iſle of <hi>Thalaſſia.</hi> Their number was conſiderable, and that day <hi>Lentulus</hi>'s invitation of them to a Collation, had aſſembled them. The two Friends of <hi>Ovid</hi> inform'd him of the quality, and name of each perſon, which compos'd that noble Convention. He ſaluted <hi>Tiſienus Galius,</hi> but not without a bluſh. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> preſented to him a fair Cozen of his, nam'd <hi>Adiamante,</hi> who was Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to <hi>Roſelina.</hi> There were likewiſe two or three Inhabitants of <hi>Lesbos,</hi> who came every year about that ſeaſon to furniſh the <hi>Thalaſſian</hi> Exiles with what Commodities, they wanted. Many were curious to be inform'd from <hi>Ovid</hi>'s mouth, of the cauſe of his viſiting that Iſland; but he reſerv'd that ſecret for his particular Friends; and only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd to others, that it was in obedience to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Commands. He added moreover, that his Conſcience could lay no crime to his charge, but that he could not pronounce himſelf wholly inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent neither, ſince <hi>Caeſar</hi> had been pleas'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him guilty. This modeſty of his prov'd no example to be imitated, by thoſe that were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to it; for they fixt the Title of Cruelty and Injuſtice upon the Emperor's Commands; and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Maxim of moſt of your Exiles, who do not perceive, that in darting ſuch murmurs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94435:6"/> at their rebounding miſeries, they only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter fuel to thoſe flames, they endeavor to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. Our Malecontents indulg'd that liberty to their tongues, which the reſt of their bodies could not command. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> engag'd this new Gueſt to take his quarters with him. <hi>Lentulus</hi> would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have rais'd a friendly debate upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had he not been oblig'd to another for his own.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Ovid</hi> ſaw himſelf alone with <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> he thought he ſhould do an injury to his friendſhip, if he ſhould obſerve that precaution with him, which he practis'd towards perſons, wholly indifferent to it. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> had been a Friend of very ancient acquaintance; and he made no ſcruple to tell him, that the favors, wherewith the daughter of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was pleas'd to honor him, had been whiſper'd in the Emperor's ear, and occaſion'd his Baniſhment: you make me but half your Confident, ſayes <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> interrupting him: I have ſuch correſpondence at <hi>Rome,</hi> as will not ſuffer me to be ignorant of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of a misfortune, wherein I claim my ſelf ſo near a concern. Confeſs the truth, my dear <hi>Ovid,</hi> cry'd he, with a ſmile; <hi>Caeſar</hi> would have pardon'd you the glorious attack, you made upon the heart of <hi>Julia,</hi> had you confin'd the luſtre of your merit within the circumference of that orb; the Emperor ought to take ſatisfaction in the gallantries of his daughter; and his Court would become a Deſart, ſhould the honor to ſerve her, be adjudg'd a crime of State: But you have attackt that Prince in a more ſenſible part, and the fair <hi>Terentia</hi> was not able to reſiſt the influence of ſo powerful a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94435:6"/>
               <p>See, ſee here, cry'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> one of the moſt cruel darts malice can level at my diſgrace. I received the ſentence of my Baniſhment with conſtancy enough; but I am not able without tranſport to hear <hi>Terentia</hi> branded with a weakneſs, ſhe is ſo little capable of. I will not endeavor, ſaid <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius,</hi> to extort a more ingenuous confeſſion from you: the method you take to vindicate the fair <hi>Terentia,</hi> ſatisfies me, to what degree you love her; and as I hold it for a circumſtance of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, that a Lady of capacity and judgement ſhould be ador'd by you, without a reciprocal eſteem and reſpect; I aſſure my ſelf that my Agents have good correſpondence, and I will ſend them my thanks in my next Letters, for the faithful intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, they furniſh me with. I call the gods to witneſs, reply'd <hi>Ovid'</hi> that no report had ever ſo falſe a falſe a ground, to ſupport its malice, as this of a Love-intrigue betwixt <hi>Terentia</hi> and my ſelf: I cannot deny but that I have a veneration for her equal to her merit; She has the command of a clear and piercing judgment, and being affected with ſome places in my Writings (where my Pen has been more induſtrious and luxuriant) than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other woman poſſibly might be, I doubt not but ſhe may have a more particular eſteem for me than a perſon of leſs capacity: but whereas beſides that ſhe ſeem'd to me not to be capable of a Paſſion for any other, but the Emperor; I am endear'd to the brave <hi>Moecenas</hi> by obligations too ſtrait, to make a criminal attempt upon the chaſtity of his Wife. Oh! ſaid <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> by what chains of merit and obligations is not <hi>Caeſar</hi> bound to that illuſtrious Favourite? What does he not owe to the zeal and prudence of that Great Man? What has not <hi>Moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenas</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:94435:7"/> acted to eſtabliſh him in the Imperial Throne of the Univerſe? With what vigilance did he diſarm the attempts, which were levelled at his life? With what fidelity does he aſſiſt him by his Counſels? And do we ſee <hi>Auguſtus</hi> make any ſcruple to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh from him the heart and affections of his Wife? I do not think my ſelf oblig'd, reply'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> to vindicate the Honor of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> for the breaſt of a baniſh'd Man, is the natural ſeat of malice and revenge; and I have left behind me at <hi>Rome</hi> thoſe concerns, which will always ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to them a high reſentment of thoſe commands which caſt me out of it. But if the lovely <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia</hi> had practis'd as much art and diligence to endear me to her, as ſhe has done to improve the Emperors affections towards her, and <hi>Moecenas</hi> would have expreſs'd the ſame compliance in my favor, as he did in his Maſters, perhaps <hi>Ovid</hi> might have as much forgotten himſelf as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> has done. You cannot affirm, reply'd <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but <hi>Moecenas</hi> did expreſs ſome in yours, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe young <hi>Craſſus</hi> could not have ſurpriz'd you one night-coming out of her Appartment. Since you have been made acquainted, ſaid <hi>Ovid,</hi> with that encounter, I ſhall confide the ſecret to you: You are prudent, and my friend; make uſe of my confidence in you, as it becomes a man of honor, that profeſſes he has eſpouſed my Intereſts.</p>

               <head>THE HISTORY OF OVID.</head>
               <p>I Should in vain ſtudy to render my ſelf guilty of a black ingratitude, in going about to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own thoſe generous favors, the glorious Daughter of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> has grac'd me with; which my ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment has caus'd the World to believe were ſo great, that I cannot think it will be interpreted a vanity, or indiſcretion in me to repreſent them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it in their due character: wherefore I ſhall avow a truth, and confeſs, that that excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs did treat me with a freedom and confidence, the memory whereof ſtill is, and ever ſhall be, as pretious to me, as my unfortunate life.</p>
               <p>She gave me the liberty to conſecrate to her <hi>Idea</hi> all thoſe paſſionate Poems, which I publiſh'd under the name of <hi>Corinna.</hi> She was oftentimes pleas'd to anſwer the little Harangues of Love, the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Rhetorick of my eyes, made to her, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards as full of ſweetneſs, as mine were of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which gave encouragement to my preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make thoſe attempts, which might with ſome reaſon be interpreted as criminal, in a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Chevalier, ſince they had for their object the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94435:8"/> Daughter of his Emperor; but would have been judg'd innocent, had <hi>Julia</hi> been the Daughter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight.</p>
               <p>Varniſh that piece over, quoth <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, with as light a hand as you can; I ſee the inclination you have to make a fair Apology for a fair friend; I am acquainted already with every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the Intrigue betwixt you and <hi>Julia,</hi> and I deſire only an account of what relates to <hi>Terentia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You are in an error, reply'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> and to diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs you of it, I muſt beg your patience to a Diſcourſe, which may perhaps detain it longer than you deſire The beginning of a Love-intrigue with the firſt Princeſs of the World you muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, was ſufficient to charm the ſpirit of an ambitious man with raptures, ſcarce comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by imagination it ſelf. I conſider'd the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſhe honor'd me with in her eſteem, before all others of my Rank in the Court, with a moſt raviſhing ſatisfaction; and acting the part of a great Prince in the private Converſes ſhe was pleas'd to admit me to, I could fancy my ſelf nothing leſs than one of the happieſt in the Univerſe. I forgot the quality both of <hi>Julia,</hi> and my ſelf; but as the Princeſs (let malice and detraction ſpend their mouths as loud as they will, to blemiſh her virtue) did always reſerve to her ſelf, as a Royal Prerogative of her Greatneſs, the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing my audacity; all the little ſatisfactions ſhe permitted me, ſerv'd but to tantalize my vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and only entertain'd my Love with ſome ſlight Banquet of Sweatmeats, which thirſted after a more ſolid repaſt. <hi>Julia</hi> is one of the moſt charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beauties of the Univerſe; and my deſires, which had kindled a new <hi>Aetna</hi> within my breaſt,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94435:8"/> wanting the bleſſings of a gentle ſhowre from her more ſubſtantial favors, to qualifie its flames, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted all thoſe flattering pleaſures into an inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable torment. <hi>Sulpicia,</hi> Wife to <hi>Tiſienus Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> who is here in <hi>Thalaſſia,</hi> that then was Servant to the Princeſs, and to whom ſhe unlockt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of all her ſecrets, was a witneſs to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable eſtate, thoſe her half Bounties had reduc'd me to. <hi>Tiſienus</hi> about that time was ſuſpected to have been a Complice in the Conſpiracy of <hi>Marcus Lepidus,</hi> and baniſh'd into this Iſland. His ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence gave <hi>Sulpicia</hi> the freedom to exerciſe thoſe liberties his moroſe humor retrench'd her from, when he was with her. This generous perſon was toucht with a compaſſion of my Sufferings, and was ſparing neither of her advice, nor inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt for the advancing of my felicity. This your manner of proceeding with <hi>Ovid,</hi> ſaid ſhe to the Princeſs, is as much oppoſite to the rules of Love, as Virtue; you ſuffer a perſon to expire at your feet, whom you love; becauſe a little punctilio; perhaps, either of State, or Modeſty, will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you to allow him the benefit of your Mercy; when you ſhall do them both but an equal injury, either by enſlaving them to theſe terms of rigor and ſeverity, or indulging them thoſe liberties from which reſtrain them. Eeither aſſume the Character of the Daughter of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or with courage renounce the arbitrary Yoke it would impoſe upon your freedom. A Virtue that can admit of the leaſt allay of any other ignobler paſſion, is but the ſlave of irreſolution and timidity; you ought either to baniſh him your preſence for ever, or render it leſs mortal to him. The Spirit of <hi>Julia</hi> could digeſt neither of thoſe Propoſitions. My conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94435:9"/> was a diverſion to her; the languiſhing countenance of my love rais'd a tender compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in her breaſt; but her favors never extended themſelves beyond the bounds of that compaſſion; and though ſhe had an invincible repugnance to deprive her ſelf of my ſight, ſhe had likewiſe no leſs to grant me the Suit, which <hi>Sulpicia</hi> was my Advocate in. She did teſtifie the regret ſhe had, for not being capable of doing me a more accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervice in my affairs in terms ſo obliging, that I thought I was not able to retaliate her kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs no other way, than by making an offer to her of what remain'd of my ſelf in my own diſpoſal. If the lovely <hi>Sulpicia,</hi> ſaid I to her, could be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of that condeſcenſion, as to content her ſelf with the ſecond rank in a heart, where the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſits in Throne in the firſt; and that the illuſtrious <hi>Julia</hi> would not conſider, as a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon committed again her ſelf, that ſubmiſſion, which low proſtrate at your feet, I would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy to plead the cauſe of my misfortunes; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſtate wherein you now behold me, and which has already excited compaſſion in your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble breaſt, would ſoon be ſenſible of a glorious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration. <hi>Sulpicia</hi> burſt forth into a loud fit of laughter at this propoſition, and regarding me with no leſs ſurpriſe than diſdain: Have you an art then, ſaid ſhe, to divide your ſelf ſo exactly, that neither the Princeſs, nor <hi>Sulpicia</hi> ſhall have cauſe to impeach you of partiality in the diviſion? It is a ſecret I muſt confeſs, ſaid I, I never yet put in practice; but a ſmall condeſcenſion in the Soul of the Princeſs, and the like compaſſion in yours, would encourage me to make the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For example, went I on, ſuppoſe your
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94435:9"/> ſelf wholly ignorant of the Amours betwixt the Princeſs and my ſelf; and that retiring all inflames and tranſports from the Elyſium of her private Careſſes, I ſhould throw at your feet a heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd with raptures and deſires as violent, as love with all its Magick were able to raiſe in it, would you judge the victim unworthy of your accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? No, reply'd <hi>Sulpicia,</hi> if the cauſe of theſe tranſports and deſires were unknown to me, and I could flatter my ſelf with the thought, that my Beauty had kindled the flames, I ſaw ſo viſible an effect of. Oh! ye gods, cry'd I, preſently, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting her, muſt I then be culpable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, becauſe the Princeſs has made you her Confident? You deny not, but that my love, in the ſame capacity I repreſent it you, both ſhould, and ought, to be favourably embrac'd by a perſon; who could believe her ſelf to be the only object of it: And what reaſon can there be then, that I ſhould receive ſo ſevere correction for an indiſcretion I never committed? Are my tranſports leſs tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports for being the effects of the Princeſs, irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Charms? Or ſhould I bring them with me into <hi>Sulpicia's</hi> Chamber heightned with all thoſe raptures ſhe knows them capable of, would my Paſſion be a leſs amorous Paſſion for having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd its birth from the divine eyes of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable <hi>Julia?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My way of reaſoning was thought ſo pleaſant by <hi>Sulpicia,</hi> that ſhe ſuddenly left me, to run and make the Princeſs a Partaker in the gallantry of it: I endeavour'd to diſſuade her, but could not. I judg'd it convenient to make choice of a fit ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to treat of ſo delicate and tender a ſubject; when I was moſt agreeably ſurpriz'd to underſtand
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94435:10"/> from the mouth of <hi>Sulpicia,</hi> that the ſingularity it ſelf of my propoſition had commended it to the Princeſſes favor, who expreſs'd a great ſatisfacti- for the advancing an Intrigue ſo admirable, and new.</p>
               <p>About that time I had made a Poem, Entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>THE GODDESS OF HEARTS;</hi> where feigning that <hi>Cupid</hi> ſeeing that his Mother <hi>Venus</hi> had a greater charge upon her hands than ſhe could well manage, in charming Mortals, had thought it expedient for her to aſſume to her a Co-partner in her Empire of Love, and by the name of <hi>The Goddeſs of Hearts,</hi> had created the Princeſs <hi>Julia,</hi> here Co-ſovereign in ſwaying the <hi>AMORO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> Scepter of the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs, through an indiſcretion, which I never took the preſumption to charge her with, ſhow'd this fancy of mine to <hi>Terentia.</hi> The name of <hi>Julia</hi> was diſguis'd under that of <hi>Corinna;</hi> but the Character of <hi>Corinna</hi> did ſo perfectly il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the Daughter of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> that <hi>Terentia</hi> had no difficulty to diſcover it. She drew me one evening apart in the Empreſſes Apartment, and ſhowing me the Verſes the Princeſs had deliver'd to her. Sould not one, ſaid ſhe, oblige you effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, to preſent you with the Key of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Work, and unlock the ſecret of it to the Emperor. This diſcourſe put me into ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, but re-compoſing my ſelf in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I could: I cannot think, Madam, reply'd I, the Emperor will concern his high Thoughts with the humble <hi>Corinna</hi> of <hi>Ovid;</hi> and if he were pleas'd to ſtoop them ſo low to Earth, the Title of <hi>THE GODDESS OF HEARTS,</hi> ſo gloriouſly ſuits the Charms of the divine <hi>Terentia,</hi> that he might
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94435:10"/> perhaps interpret her to be of the object of this fancy, and caſt a killing eye upon <hi>Ovid,</hi> for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming to bring the illuſtrious Wife of <hi>Mecaenas</hi> upon the Theatre of an Amour. You have more ingenuity than ſincerity, reply'd <hi>Terentia,</hi> and the artificial varniſh you give your anſwer, ought to oblige me to repay treachery with treachery; but I have an eſteem for you, and deſire you to inſert me in the firſt Rank of your friends. You may go on, and propoſe to your Muſe the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Julia,</hi> for her Goddeſs; but your love in her Mouth ſpeaks intelligibly; and her language is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be underſtood by perſons leſs diſcreet than my ſelf, and who perhaps will not have ſo great a regard to the intereſts of <hi>Ovid,</hi> as <hi>Terentia</hi> has.</p>
               <p>This generous proceeding of a perſon, whom the credit of a grand Favourite, and the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Emperor, had elevated to the higheſt ſphear of authority and luſtre in the Empire, did touch me with the ſenſe of a deep acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which I expreſt in the moſt eloquent terms, my gratitude could prompt to me; and from that day I conſecrated to her generoſity all the Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of my Muſe, which either my Paſſion for the Daughter of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> or my eſteem for <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picia</hi> would permit me to borrow from her more Amorous hours. About that time <hi>Craſſus</hi> began to pay his Adorations to the Shrine of this reſplendent Star. And this Amour ſcarce deceiv'd the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any perſon in <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Emperors, and her brave Husbands. He had obſerved how this great Lady had call'd me aſide; and it was eaſie to diſcover by the motion of her eyes, and her geſture, that ſhe was ſaying ſome obliging thing unto me: He drew near, and lent his curious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94435:11"/> but we ſpoke ſo low, that he could frame no connexion in any thing he heard us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of: He catch'd only at ſome ſcattered and broken words, as the Title of <hi>GODDESS OF HEARTS,</hi> and what I had reply'd to the firſt ſpeech of <hi>Terentia;</hi> which being but an innocent piece of Gallantry, without deſign, I was not cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to render guilty by a whiſper: And ſeeing, in fine, that I pay'd my thanks to her in the moſt humble poſture, and the gratefull'ſt terms I was able to expreſs, he preſently apprehended, that I had entertain'd her with ſome private Love-adventure, which ſhe gave a favorable ear to; and this fancy begot in him a furious jealouſie: and ſome few days after preſented him with an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to confirm it: I was walking in the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Gardens of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> when a little after me came <hi>Terentia</hi> thither likewiſe, to make them more beautiful, led by the Great <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and follow'd by <hi>Craſſus;</hi> who ſeem'd to be a ſhadow inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly annex'd to each motion of her perſon. He uſher'd the young <hi>Heluidia,</hi> Niece to <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> by the hand; and endeavour'd to caſt a blind before the eyes of the publick, by perſuading them, that it was either this Lady, or the young <hi>Aurelia,</hi> who were uſually her Attendants, that with their Charms did daily attract him into the company of the fair <hi>Terentia;</hi> but more piercing ſights did penetrate into the Miſtery. <hi>Terentia</hi> by accident ſaw me croſs the end of an Alley, where ſhe was walking: She ſent ſome of her Servants after me to call me: and as I approach'd her, <hi>Ovid,</hi> ſaid ſhe, inclining her ſelf a little towards my Ear, offers a Sacrifice too remarkable to his Goddeſs, the Grand-Courtiers of Heaven begin to murmur at it, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94435:11"/> 
                  <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf is offended. Can Sacrifice offend the Gods Madam? ſaid I, walking by her ſide; and are not thoſe Holocauſts, which preſerve on Earth our reſpect and veneration to the Goddeſſes, ſacred and pure enough to be offer'd publickly to them? I know not what you treat of, ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,</hi> ſmiling, but were I a Goddeſs, the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary offers of men, would cauſe me to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſome private intereſt, or deſign, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the ambitious offerer: And I do not find, that it is natural to Mortals of <hi>Ovids</hi> merit, to make always pure devotion the object of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. I am of your opinion, reply'd <hi>Terentia,</hi> a perſon of <hi>Ovids</hi> Principals will ſoon become as formidable to the Gods of the Earth, as the Gyants were once to thoſe of Heaven: wherefore if I were of his Council, I would adviſe him to be ſo cautious in paying his worſhip to a certain Deity, that none of the Imperial Court above, ſhould be ſenſible of it, but herſelf.</p>
               <p>You will apprehend, by what you have heard before, that this diſcourſe of <hi>Terentia,</hi> was only a proſecution of that ſhe had began to me in the Empreſſes Apartment; and that by my Goddeſs, and the diſpleaſure of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſhe would private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuggeſt to me my love to <hi>Julia,</hi> and advertiſe me, that the Emperor was offended with my fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viſits, and familiarity with that Princeſs: But <hi>Craſſus,</hi> who lent a diligent attention to our diſcourſe, gave it another interpretation. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd ſuch anſwers as I thought moſt oppoſite to retort the flatteries they levelled at me. Our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menade,</hi> extended it ſelf to a more than ordinary length; which I ſupported with ſuch expreſſions of gallantry and pleaſant retorts, as merited to be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94435:12"/> honor'd with many a glorious Compliment and Encomium by the fair <hi>Terentia,</hi> which, I muſt confeſs did bear the character of ſo much good will and kindneſs towards me, as would have ſtartl'd the courage of any baſhful Lover. The Emperor came in queſt of his illuſtrious Miſtreſs into the Walks; as ſoon as I ſaw him I retir'd: The whole Court was not ignorant that he deſir'd always to entertain <hi>Terentia</hi> in private, and <hi>Craſſus</hi> was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged more than any other perſon, not to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the circumſtance, of being a witneſs to their Converſe; he withdrew as well as I; and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me cloſe at the heels, overtook me upon the Terraſs that bounds the Gardens, towards the River <hi>Tyber.</hi> May a man aſpire, ſaid he, ſaluting me, without temerity, to a minutes diſcourſe with the renown'd <hi>Ovid?</hi> Does not the ſpiritual <hi>Terentia,</hi> and the great <hi>Agrippa,</hi> beget in you a loathing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perſons of Plebeian Capacities? 'Tis true, ſaid I ſmiling, <hi>Ovid's</hi> ſpirit has an antipathy againſt all baſe and ſordid converſation; and thence it proceeds, that he is ſo ambitious, of that of the noble <hi>Craſſus.</hi> We meaſur'd the length of the Terraſs, with ſuch diſcourſes as theſe. <hi>Craſſus</hi> gave them the firſt diverſion, and talking a while of things indifferent, at length with a kind of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected cenfidence (he would ſeem to repoſe in me) he began to acquaint me with the deſign he had to gain ſome conſiderable employ in the Army, which was marching for <hi>Illyria.</hi> You do not deal with me, added he, with that candor, as I with you; you ſee my heart meets you bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd and open breaſted; and you have yet never honor'd me with the confidence of the leaſt of your Secrets. My heart, ſaid I, has hitherto been
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94435:12"/> the Cabinet of very few Secrets: not has it ever been engag'd in any Intrigue of State: The myſtery of ſome youthful gallantry has yet been the higheſt Point, either in the wheel of fortune or ambition it has aſpired to; and by a misfortune, which my fate, not deſigns have drawn upon me, my Love-adventures do tread the ſtage of the World ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, that it were a high piece of vanity in me, to go about to confide them, to a perſon of <hi>Craſſus</hi>'s intelligence. You are a grand diſſembler, reply'd <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and thoſe Adventures you abandon to the publick, are only caſt before their eyes like a jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Miſt, to dazle them ſo, that they may not through that thick Cloud diſcern the real ones: nor do you doubt to ſacrifice ſome credulous Dames, who are the Stales only to your deſigns, to the ſafety of your more effective Miſtreſſes. And as we ſaw not long ago with what artifice you made young <hi>Valerius</hi> himſelf, for two years together, the Stalking-horſe to his Siſters diſhonor. I'll ſwear the open feint you make at <hi>Sulpicia</hi> muſt include a ſublime and intricate Myſtery. This diſcourſe made me tremble, for the concern I had for <hi>Julia.</hi> What reaſon have you to deny, ſaid I, that the beauty of <hi>Sulpicia</hi> ought not to challenge the whole Empire of a heart, though capable of never ſo boundleſs a Paſſion? I will not prove my ſelf guilty of ſo great an arrogance, as to boaſt my ſelf worthy to make love to the fair <hi>Sulpicia;</hi> but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I were, has not <hi>Sulpicia</hi> think you, Wit and Charms enough to ſatiate each appetite of my Soul? Let her have all the Wit and Beauty too in the World, if you pleaſe, ſaid <hi>Craſſus;</hi> I will not endeavor to convince your ſuppoſition; but I ſhall maintain, that <hi>Sulpicia</hi> is not the Goddeſs of <hi>Ovid;</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:94435:13"/> you underſtand too well to frame your applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to give the title of Goddeſs to the Wife of <hi>Tiſienus.</hi> Lovers, ſaid I, interrupting him, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the name of Goddeſs, to all ſuch Objects as receive from them the Sacrifice of ſighs and vows; neither is it the Rank, nor the Quality of any of the Sex, that can ſnatch this Laurel out of the mouth of a Lover, and crown their own temples with it; but 'tis the ſuitable harmony and proportion which is found between the title of Goddeſs, and the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Heart, that does fix it there. When <hi>Paris</hi> made love to the Shepherdeſs of <hi>Oenona,</hi> he gave her the ſame title he afterwards gave to the Wife of the <hi>Spartan</hi> King. But you do not aſcribe, ſaid <hi>Craſſus,</hi> interrupting him, the name of the ſame Goddeſs of Hearts to <hi>Sulpicia,</hi> as you do to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more eminent: you offer up your feign'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions to the Wife of <hi>Tiſienus,</hi> but your real ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to the conſort of <hi>Mecoenas.</hi> This laſt word was the thread to guide me out of a Labyrinth of confuſions; for all that <hi>Craſſus</hi> imputed to <hi>Sulpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> might ſo aptly be apply'd to the Daughter of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> that till I heard the Conſort of <hi>Mecoenas</hi> nam'd, I thought the whole Intrigue had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd. I aſſum'd courage, when I ſaw my fears were deluded, and regarding <hi>Craſſus</hi> with a brisk air in my countenance; I underſtand you very well, ſaid I, you take pleaſure to introduce a diſcourſe of the ſubject you love: but you might have ſpar'd your ſelf the trouble, to derive its ſtreams from ſo remote a head; I am complaiſant to the deſires of my friends, and we might have employ'd the time of our converſation to better advantage, if I had thought your deſign in entring into diſcourſe with me, had been only to interweave it with that of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94435:13"/> the divine <hi>Terentia.</hi> The intervention of <hi>Domitius Aenobarbus,</hi> who walk'd likewiſe upon the ſame Terraſs, prevented <hi>Craſſus</hi> from making me an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: he was upon us ſo unexpectedly, that we were forc'd to diſcontinue our Converſe. You are acquainted with <hi>Domitius;</hi> he is one of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of greateſt merit in the Court of <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> and had married one of the Daughters of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Octavia.</hi> We could not decline his encounter as we might have done another of leſs conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He invited me to Sup with him; and as ſoon as the Moon ſhould lend us her ſilver Torch, engag'd me to wait upon him to a noble Palace he had built at <hi>Picene;</hi> I continued there three days, which my abſence from <hi>Julia</hi> cauſed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear three ages to me. Beſides the pleaſure ſuch a raviſhing object would have afforded me, I was impatient to communicate to her, the advice I had received from <hi>Terentia</hi> in the Gardens of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and conſult her about the beſt means to elude the Emperors ſuſpition. As ſoon as I put foot out of ſtirrup, I haſten'd to her Apartment. She was in her Cloſet with <hi>Sulpicia;</hi> the door was ſhut, but I had ofttntimes before taken the liberty to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them in their privacy, the Princeſs not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approving it: <hi>Sulpicia</hi> came forth when ſhe ſaw me; but <hi>Julia</hi> ſtood with her face turn'd from me towards the Window: I thought I diſcover'd by the eyes of <hi>Sulpicia,</hi> that ſomething of diſcontent haſt paſt betwixt the Princeſs and her ſelf: <hi>Julia</hi> held ſome flowers in her hand, which ſhe ſnapt off, and threw away, with an action full of paſſion and indignation: I approacht her with all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and beg'd her to let me know wherein thoſe innocent Flowers had diſpleas'd her. If you ever
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94435:14"/> ſee her more, ſaid ſhe, without giving an anſwer to my demand, you muſt not expect to ſee me again as long as you live. How, reply'd I, in a ſtrange ſurprize, muſt I never ſee my Princeſs more? What Devil ſhall have the power to deprive me of the adorable ſight of my Goddeſs? The ill advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Sulpicia,</hi> ſaid the Princeſs. It ſeems I renounc'd the whole ſtock of intereſt I had in you, when I gave her leave to claim a ſmall branch in it; nor does ſhe doubt to tell me to my face, that her ſhare in you is more conſiderable than mine; but ſhe ſhall not long have cauſe to boaſt of theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; for if I may pretend to any power over you, ſhe ſhall ſoon ſee herſelf retrench'd of all your other favors, but indifferent viſits. I leave you to judge to what a pitch of joy this pretty jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous concern of the Princeſs did elevate my Soul. I was cautious not to impart to her the advice <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia</hi> had given me; it had come ſeaſonable to me; and to diſoblige <hi>Sulpicia</hi> in a conjuncture wherein the Emperors emergent ſuſpitions began to threaten danger to our affairs, had been to hazard a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But the intereſt of Love ſeldom complies with the rules of Prudence. I heap'd a Million of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions upon each ſyllable her indignation utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; I limn'd to her a diviſion in Love, in colors, which expreſt it in all the ſhapes of horror and deformity; I complain'd of the injuſtice ſhe had done all thoſe faithful devoirs my love had rendr'd her by indulging it ſo much liberty; and I earneſtly conjur'd her by a moſt ſtrict Edict of her ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign diſpleaſure to repeal all thoſe ſhe had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd me to render to <hi>Sulpicia.</hi> The Princeſs gave attention to all I ſaid, but anſwered me only in the language of a troubled Meen, which I did interpret
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94435:14"/> as a good <hi>omen.</hi> I ask'd her divers queſtions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vanities of <hi>Sulpicia;</hi> ſhe declar'd ſome of them to me, and leſt me to divine the reſt. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that <hi>Sulpicia</hi> had done me greater ſervices by her indiſcretion, than her counſels; and by magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying her own advantages and intereſt, had not a little advanc'd mine: I had hopes the Sun would have broken forth gloriouſly upon me, after theſe ſweet dawnings of my Princeſſes conſtancy and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor towards me, had not the arrival of the Prince <hi>Marcellus,</hi> wholly eclips'd it; but I had the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to perceive, this diſappointment was as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome to the Princeſs, as my ſelf; which ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with a geſture full of chagrin and diſcontent; and inclining herſelf towards my ear, ſhe order'd me not to fail to attend her in the Flower-garden, which the windows of her apartment look d out upon, as ſoon as the Emperor was gone to his repoſe. We will decide our controverſie, ſaid ſhe aloud, at the hour appointed; this time is not proper for ſuch diſputes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcellus</hi> ask'd her, What the diſpute was? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſaid <hi>Julia,</hi> but a ſmall difficulty I have ſtarted to <hi>Ovid,</hi> touching his Treatiſe <hi>de Arte Amandi;</hi> and taking a Manuſcript of it up in her hand, which by accident lay before her upon the Table in her Cloſet, ſhe ſurpriz'd me with the preſence of her ſudden wit and apprehenſion: And <hi>ex tempore</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a diſpute with ſuch ingenuity and ſolidity of Reaſons, as if ſhe had dedicated the ſtudy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation of many hours to the contexture of ſo elegant a diſcourſe; and by uttering a thouſand things, which plauſibly ſuiting the Subject in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did likewiſe ſuit with what had paſt, before the Princes arrival, ſhe ſtruck me into that admiration,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94435:15"/> that I was afraid, leſt the unadvis'd Effects of it might have prov'd Traytors to their Sovereign Princeſs. I took my leave, and went to prepare the appetite of my Soul for that divine Treat, I hop'd that night would afford it. I make this Relation to a perſon, who has declar'd himſelf to the World, a Nonconformiſt in the Religion of Love; and has rather choſen the barbarous Iſle of <hi>Thalaſſia</hi> for a Miſtriſs, than a beautiful Lady for a Wife; and therefore is incapable to judge of the ſtate, my hope and impatience reduc'd me to. I was poſſeſt with a kind of amorous diſtraction, which render'd both ſolitude and company equally burdenſom to me. Each moment ſeem'd an Age to me in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and being impatient to deceive my impatience, going forth to divert it in <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Palace, I kept continually in motion, and with large paces meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the diſtance between one Apartment and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I was not capable of making a ſerious reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the ſubject, that might be the cauſe of ſo reſtleſs a diſtemper. This motion, at length, like all others, was terminated in its centre. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, at that time, was enter'd into a ſmall courſe of Phyſic, which he us'd to obſerve every Spring. The Prince <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and <hi>Moecenas,</hi> came into <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia</hi>'s Chamber, where I was; and told her that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was retir d. It was not yet the ordinary hour, the young Prince us'd to withdraw to his Repoſe: He made a Propoſition to them of ſpending an hour or two at Play: <hi>Moecenas</hi> agreed to it; and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern either for one ſide, or other, had engag'd all their idle Followers. I threw away a little time in looking upon them, not to render the haſtineſs of my departure ſuſpected; and thinking that I had obſerv'd all the neceſſary Rules of Policy, I took my
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94435:15"/> time, and ſtole in all ſilence away from them; when, unexpectedly, one of <hi>Terentia</hi>'s Women came after me, and told me, her Lady had ſome buſineſs with me, and deſir'd me to walk into the next Room; I thought, at firſt, to have deny'd obedience to this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but the fear I had, leſt the cauſe of my diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience might be ſuſpected, join'd to the ſincere eſteem and veneration I had for <hi>Terentia,</hi> caus'd me to yield an unwilling obedience to it. <hi>Terentia</hi> had a deſire to impart to me the deſign of a piece of galantry, ſhe was preparing to ſolemnize on the birth day of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> which was then near at hand. The thing intended requir'd no great premeditation: and if my wits had been in my own poſſeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a quarter of an hour had been ſufficient to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the whole Scene; but I was ſo little my ſelf, that I ſcarce took notice of what ſhe ſaid to me. I forc'd her to repeat one thing two or three times over. She was ſenſible of my diſtraction, and ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ask'd me, If I had not been that day at ſome Treat? You know, very well, Madam, anſwer'd I, that <hi>Bacchus</hi> is not my Deity; but I proteſt that my wits are at this preſent ſo far from home, that if you do not allow me this night to compoſe them, your Mask will be very ill regulated. <hi>Terentia</hi> is endow'd with one of the ſharpeſt apprehenſions in the world; and unfortunately for me, was that night in a humor of Railery. She conjectur'd what it was, that had put me off of the hinges, and propoſing to me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers queſtions of Wit and Gallantry upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my Amours, which ſhe thought would moſt oblige me, ſhe detein'd me two long hours, maugre all the attempts I could make, to diſingage my ſelf, without rudeneſs, from her importunities. <hi>Craſſus</hi> was one of the Spectators, when Prince <hi>Marcellus,</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:94435:16"/> and <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> began to ſet themſelves to play; I could not divert his jealouſie: For <hi>Domitius</hi>'s arrival had prevented me, when I was going about to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive his ill opinion of me; and from that hour I had alwayes been abſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> or in ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion or other, which gave me no opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our diſcourſe, or converſe. He obſerv'd how one of <hi>Terentia</hi>'s Women, had come to me, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded my ſtay, when I was going forth; he ſaw me direct my courſe, towards a Chamber, whither he had ſeen <hi>Terentia</hi> retire a little before; he ſtood Sentinel, with much impatience, to watch for my coming out, and was enrag'd, that I ſhould be cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd up two hours together with the perſon, to whom he had ſacrific'd his higheſt adorations. His jealouſie tranſported his fury beyond his reaſon, which caus'd him to follow me out of <hi>Mecoenas</hi>'s a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment; and to conceal the cauſe, as I conjecture, of his reſentment, from thoſe eyes, which were then upon him, he curb'd the effects of it, till he ſaw me juſt at the Gate of <hi>Mecoenas</hi>'s Baths, which opens into the Garden, where I was commanded to attend. Turn again, <hi>Ovid,</hi> ſaid he, advancing towards me with his Sword in his hand; the Bleſſings Fortune ſhowrs down on thy glorious head, is worth a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding an inglorious life; for I knew the voice of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and apprehended his error; but it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible then, to convince him of it; he attack'd me with a fury, which would not allow me time to open my lips to undeceive him. The Prince <hi>Marcellus</hi> arriv'd, juſt as we began to draw blood from each others veins; and ſeparating us, expreſt to us, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging terms, the concern he was in, to ſee two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſo much honor, as either of us were, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in ſo deſperate a quarrel. Whil'ſt the Prince
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94435:16"/> was endeavoring to part us, a Maid-ſlave of the Princeſs, who waited for me at the Garden-door, to conduct me to a cloſe Arbor, whither her Lady was retir'd, hearing the claſhing of our ſwords and voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ran haſtily to advertiſe her of our combat. The Princeſs imagin'd herſelf to be the cauſe of it; and thinking that this had been ſome ambuſh laid for me to chaſtiſe my audacity, ſhe came running to the place, in a mortal diſtraction, betwixt love and fear. Her apprehenſion had rob d her of her judgment; and ſhe let fall ſome unadvis'd words, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd our intrigue; and being join'd to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that unſeaſonable hour, rais'd that ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the breaſt of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Nephew, that no diſguiſe could longer conceal from him. <hi>Marcellus</hi> was a Prince of great honor and virtue; but the hopes that did elevate him to the thoughts of aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Marriage of <hi>Julia,</hi> had ſtamp'd a new character upon the goodneſs of his nature. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs d his complaints to the Emperor, againſt the indiſcretion and diſhonourable carriage of his daughter; which ſo inflam'd his indignation, that he preſently ſent the Princeſs away to <hi>Tuſculum,</hi> where ſo watchful a Guard was ſet over her, that I durſt not hazard any attempt either to purchaſe a ſight of her, or convey a Letter to her; and in a ſhort time after, I receiv'd the Order of my own Baniſhment. The generous <hi>Terentia</hi> employ'd her power with the Emperor, to qualifie his diſpleaſure; but the information, which the malice of ſome ill Men had whiſper'd to him, forc'd him to return her a denial. In the mean time <hi>Craſſus,</hi> (who being convinc'd by the reſentments of Prince <hi>Marcellus,</hi> had the juſtice to think, that a perſon grac'd with that favor by the daughter of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> as to obtain her
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94435:17"/> compliance to ſuch night-aſſignations, could not probably be embark'd in any other adventure of the like nature) believ'd that he had attack'd me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon. He came to take his leave of me, the ſame morning, I was to take mine of <hi>Rome;</hi> when he inform'd me of thoſe things, which you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine I could not by my ſelf arrive to the knowledge of; and teſtify'd his trouble and grief to me in terms ſo paſſionate, that they wholly diſarm'd my indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But his too late repentanee could not reſtore me my <hi>Julia</hi> again: In adventures of this nature, an occaſion once loſt, is never to be retrieved more.</p>
               <p>Whil'ſt <hi>Ovid</hi> was making this Relation of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret intrigue with <hi>Julia,</hi> the <hi>Thalaſſian</hi> Lady, to whoſe heart the blind Archer had ſent one of his moſt inviſible darts, felt the real effects of her Friends predictions. <hi>Ovid</hi>'s hopes had deceiv'd him, when he was willing to believe, that the fair <hi>Roſelina,</hi> was the private <hi>Inamorata:</hi> But the knaviſh Boy took delight to ſport with the ſevere humor of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> and it was ſhe, who was become amorous of the reputation of the famous <hi>Ovid.</hi> Oh! cruel Friend, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Roſelina,</hi> you have taught my heart a Leſſon, it ought to have been ignorant of. It is too manifeſt a truth, that the perſon of <hi>Ovid</hi> has raviſh'd from me that eſteem, which I thought nothing, but his Works had been capable to challenge. There is a Magic in the air of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which has enchanted me at the firſt ſight; and if I had not preſently retir'd from the place, where we firſt ſaw him, I believe, I ſhould not have been able to have conceal'd my ſurprize from the obſervation of the Company. Alas! went ſhe on, with a ſigh, Love takes now too cruel a revenge, of the contempt, I have alwayes hitherto expreſs'd for his power.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:94435:17"/>
               <p>I do not perceive, reply'd <hi>Roſelina,</hi> that this god merits that character of Revenge, you impoſe upon him: <hi>Ovid</hi> bears not in the World the repute of a cruel perſon; and I am deceiv'd, if he be of that inhumane temper, as to be inſenſible of a paſſion, which is dreſs'd in ſo many Charms and Beauties, as <hi>Junia</hi> is Miſtriſs of. Ah! replied <hi>Junia,</hi> my heart ſhall never betray that ſecret to him: <hi>Ovid</hi> is the wild Ranger of <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Chaſes, and unconſtant by profeſſion, whom all the Charms, <hi>Venus</hi> herſelf is Miſtriſs of, are not able to confine to one Object; and ſhould mine, as inconſiderable, as they are, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with that miraculous power, as to influence a conſtancy upon him, <hi>Tiſienus</hi> informs me, that the cauſe of his diſgrace, is only a jealouſie of <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> And <hi>Terentia</hi>'s intereſt will quickly re-eſtabliſh him in the Emperor's favor, and the Baniſhment of <hi>Ovid</hi> will have an end, as ſoon as ſhe ſhall interpoſe her authority between him and <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s indignation. Do not you think me then moſt unfortunate in a Paſſion, which I am in danger to give entertainment to alone; and were its reciprocal, would be alwayes expos'd to the terror of an infallible ſeparation? <hi>Arimant,</hi> unhappy <hi>Arimant,</hi> ſaid ſhe, letting ſome tears fall, I now undergo a rigorous chaſtiſement for all the injuries, I have done thee.</p>
               <p>About this Seaſon, <hi>Junia</hi> was accuſtomed to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Birth-day of her Father: ſhe had upon other Years invented divers ſorts of Games and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations to honor that ſolemn day, and for this, ſhe had deſign'd a Conſort of Muſick upon a Lake, which was one of the greateſt Wonders, that il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated that Iſland. <hi>Roſelina,</hi> was her aſſiſtant in the deſign. She had acquaintance in <hi>Mitilena,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Lesbos,</hi> by means whereof, ſhe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94435:18"/> a Company of choice Muſitians from thence. They came the ſame night, that <hi>Ovid</hi> arriv'd. <hi>Junia</hi> expreſs'd all the diligences of a ſolicitous Lover, to regale her <hi>Ovid</hi> with a Banquet of Muſic, for his firſt welcome to <hi>Thalaſſia;</hi> and as the intent of this fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick had no other object, than <hi>Ovid,</hi> ſhe gave order to the Muſicians to tell all, that ſhould examine them, that <hi>Ovid</hi> had ſet them on work. The Inhabitants were much ſurpriz'd, when walking in the evening by the ſide of the Lake, they heard the noiſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers voices and inſtruments rebound from ſome Boats to the ſhore, which were purpoſely prepar'd for that Solemnity. Thoſe, who underſtood not the myſtery look'd upon one another with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and enquir'd, Who amongſt them were the Authors of this piece of Gallantry? Every one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd it; you will perceive preſently, ſaid <hi>Ovid</hi> ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that we ought to pay our thanks to <hi>Hortenſius</hi> for it. He has an intention to chaſtiſe himſelf for a fault, which he is indebted to for his baniſhment, and repealing his Error, dedicates to ſome fair Ilandreſs this public teſtimony of his converſion. Theſe falſe <hi>Elogiums,</hi> reply'd <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> cannot ſeduce my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; you muſt attack me by ſome more ſubtle ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, to make me imitate the Crow in <hi>Aeſop:</hi> And I ſhall not only not render my ſelf guilty of dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Treat to any <hi>Thalaſſian</hi> Lady, but ſhall eſteem the ſuſpition, or thought of having done it, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, I will not ſay to the honor, but humor, of <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius.</hi> This is only a glory you have, ſaid <hi>Junia,</hi> interrupting him, to make the vanity of your ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, more conſpicuous. I do not think it worth my admiration, that there are ſo many Souls in the world incapable of that generous Paſſion; the Star, which governs the ſublunary Empire of Love, is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94435:18"/> doubtleſs not without its oppoſitions; and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are of an extent vaſt enough to compriſe two contrary influences within their circumference; but general divertiſements are the innocent effects of a Gallantry, without deſign or intereſt, and like the Motto's annex'd to honorable Coats of Arms, may be practis'd as well by a heart wholly unconcern'd, as that, which is moſt inflam'd.</p>
               <p>The Spectacles, or Games, reply'd <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> we exhibit to the People, or the Diverſions and Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we preſent to our Friends, may bear that Motto of indifferency, you have character'd to us; but thoſe which are wholly conſecrated to the honor of Ladies, muſt neceſſarily include a deſign to pleaſe and oblige the Sex, which I never was, nor ever ſhall be, and am, at this moment, in deſpair of ever being capable of. I ſhall pay to it all the reſpects, a perſon of honor cannot acquit himſelf from without incivility; and if any one of them ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to that ſtreight or circumſtance, which ſhould call upon my aſſiſtance, I would afford it her with as much fidelity and zeal, as if I had been from my Cradle a profeſt Lover: But this I ſhould perform, by a principle of natural compaſſion, which is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of no partiality to either Sex; and would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs itſelf with as much concern towards the moſt unworthy of all Men, as the faireſt of all Women. I judge this indifferency of <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> ſaid <hi>Roſelina,</hi> may be a vice of that ill temperament, which nature firſt ſeaſon'd him with: but I think I ſaw another way, to derive its pedegree: the averſion he has for our Sex, is too violent to be the effect only of an antipathy without any foundation: I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is the daughter rather of Revenge, than Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and if he will be ſo ingenious, as to avouch
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94435:19"/> the truth, the Memory of ſome paſt injuries has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed this character in his Soul.</p>
               <p>I am not able, ſaid <hi>Lentulus,</hi> taking up the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to ſatisfie your doubts concerning <hi>Hortenſius;</hi> but if you have a deſire to be reſolv'd of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Neptunian</hi> harmony, I can aſſure you, that <hi>Ovid</hi> is the Author of it, and that I receiv'd my intelligence from the Mouths of the Muſicians themſelves. This News ſurpriz'd the Company with wonder, which could not ſufficiently admire by what ſtratagem <hi>Ovid</hi> had been able in ſo ſhort a time to aſſemble and unite, in one body, the various parts of ſo perfect a Conſort. Some call'd him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter, others deſir'd him to impart ſome of his Magick to them, and every one render'd him the ſubject of his own confuſion, and their aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He had ſet foot in this Iſland, in a humor little ſuiting with ſuch kind of diverſions: He was ſcarce thrown aſhore, when he encountred his two Friends, and ſince that Moment <hi>Hortenſius</hi> had never been out of his company; he deſir'd him to anſwer for his innocence, and free him from thoſe undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved praiſes, they charg'd him with. He complain'd of <hi>Lentulus</hi> for having been the Author of this diſtaſteful Railery, and conjur'd him, not without a little paſſion, to ſuppreſs a folly which had ſported too long with his afflictions, and was ſo diſagreeable a Companion for them. His Proteſtations, and his Complaints, were not regarded, but as the effects of his Modeſty; and whatever he could alledge in his excuſe, the honor of the Pageant was fix'd upon him. He was troubled to be made the Mask to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others diſguiſe: which caus'd him to riſe very early the next Morning, to find out the Merchants, who had ſold their lyes and labor at ſo cheap a rate: He
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94435:19"/> could not ſpeak with them the Evening before, for <hi>Lentulus</hi> had not publiſh'd what they had told him; till after the Conſort was ended. <hi>Ovid</hi> hop'd to make them deny, what they had ſaid, and diſcover the intrigue of this pleaſant Myſtery, but his moſt diligent ſearch could not retrieve one of them in the whole Iſland. <hi>Junia</hi> took great pleaſure in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of her innocent Railery and to give herſelf a little more diverſion, had diſcharg'd them, and ſent them away, who by break of day embark'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon a Veſſel which ſet Sail for <hi>Biſantinus.</hi> Their departure much diſpleas'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> who admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that Fortune ſhould expreſs ſo much croſsneſs to him of late, as to oppoſe moſt envious obſtacles to the leaſt of his deſires: and theſe reflexions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting him to the feet of his divine <hi>Julia</hi> in her private Cloſet, brought ſuch a Melancholy upon him, that he could not in that condition digeſt the thought of returning to <hi>Hortenſius.</hi> He took his walk into a Meadow, which his wandring fancy conducted him to: where he had ſcarce meaſured four or five paces, when he perceiv'd <hi>Roſelina</hi> trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping over the farther end of it, towards a Grove of Cypreſs Trees; which ſome Outlaws, who had been formerly confin'd to the place, had probably taken pleaſure to plant there. <hi>Ovid</hi> found this Stranger ſo charming, that though he had eſtabliſh'd <hi>Julia</hi> in the throne of his heart, for the ſovereign Empreſs of his affections, yet he judg'd he ſhould not turn Traytor to the principles of his ſworn Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, in giving a ſlight diverſion to that Mortal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, which for her abſence had invaded his Soul. He followed the tract of <hi>Roſelina;</hi> the labyrinth, which ſhe enter'd into, had been deſign'd for a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary retirement; where the paths, with a curious
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94435:20"/> artifice interwoven into divers innocent knots, as well to confound each other, as the unwary Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, were not very difficult to be trac'd through all their implicite Meanders. <hi>Ovid,</hi> with a little trouble, was guided by his cautious ſteps, to a green ſquare, encompaſs'd round with flowry banks, and other natural ſeats of fragrant verdure, which ſeem'd to be the centre of this pleaſant Wilderneſs: He found there, a Guittar and Books, in which, amongſt ſome Muſical Notes, that were blur'd and torn, he read theſe following Verſes.

               <p>At the foot of theſe Verſes, there were divers Cyphers, drawn with a Pencil, wherein the Letters, that compos'd the name of <hi>Ovid,</hi> were eaſie to be diſcern'd. He flatter'd himſelf with a belief, that his ſecret Miſtriſs, had in this place entertain'd her amorous Paſſion, and finding the method, by which ſhe expreſt it, very ingenious and elegant, he retort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in this manner.

               <p>He left a blank for his name, as well not to hazard an indiſcretion, as to oblige the Lady, to explain her ſelf firſt; and skreening himſelf behind a bank, he preſently ſaw <hi>Roſelina</hi> enter. She took the Guittar, which ſhe touch'd with admirable skill and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and in playing, caſt her eyes upon the Books, and read that which was interlin'd betwixt the Notes, as one would read a thing, he had by rote before. She was preſent, when <hi>Junia</hi> made thoſe Verſes that morning; but by accident throwing down the Book, the Leaves turn'd, and <hi>Roſelina</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd <hi>Ovid</hi>'s anſwer to them. She read it over more than once, and ſtopping at the place, where <hi>Ovid</hi> had left the blank for his name, ſhe ſeem'd to be put to a puzzle, to find out ſomething to fill it up, and ſuddenly caſting up her eyes to Heaven, and clapping her hands one againſt the other, ſhe run haſtily towards the track, which guided her out of the Labyrinth. She need not have done any more, to aſſure <hi>Ovid,</hi> that his deſires and conjectures had not deluded him. He made not the leaſt ſcruple, but that <hi>Roſelina</hi> was the Party, whoſe heart his Fame had led in triumph after him; and congratulating his happy Stars for this their benign influence, he reſolv'd to make it the diverſion of his baniſhment. <hi>Roſelina</hi> might have been eaſily overtaken by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that would have purſu'd her; but <hi>Ovid,</hi> was an experienc'd Lover, and knew with what precaution and tenderneſs he ought to manage the baſhful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of young Ladies, and leave the impreſſion of the firſt attacks, to receive its perfection from the ſtamp of more ſerious reflexions. <hi>Roſelina</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as much liberty to retire, as ſhe pleas'd: and <hi>Ovid</hi> quitted not his poſt, till he thought he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd her ſufficient time to make an entire retreat:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94435:21"/> when all tranſported with joy, that he had made ſo happy an entrance into the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> where he found <hi>Lentulus,</hi> who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to oblige his old Friend, invited him to dine with him. They fell again upon the diſcourſe of the Muſick: <hi>Ovid</hi> renew'd his complaints againſt <hi>Lentulus,</hi> for having made him the Subject of a Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, he was totally ignorant of. <hi>Lentulus</hi> confirm'd again, what he had affirm'd the night before. <hi>Ovid</hi> ſeriouſly proteſted, that thoſe Muſicians had told him a great untruth; adding a ſolemn Oath, that he had not the leaſt concern, or knowledge of a conſort, as miraculouſly vaniſh'd as at firſt aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: which, at length, alter'd the opinion of <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus;</hi> and at the ſame time the gayetie, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd before, in his countenance. <hi>Ovid</hi> ſoon took notice of it, and ask'd him the cauſe of this ſudden change? It is too manifeſt, reply'd <hi>Lentulus,</hi> that I am betray'd! O ye gods, cry'd he, fetching a deep ſigh, Is it poſſible that a perſon, who has ſo long commanded the higheſt adorations of my Soul, ſhould be capable of ſo foul a treachery? We ſhall afford you our advice and conſolation, ſaid <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> interrupting him, as ſoon as we ſhall be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the cauſe of theſe extravagant Exclamations. Alas, ſaid <hi>Lentulus,</hi> I need no intreaties to ſatisfie your curioſity: A perſon in my condition, feels a greater reluctancy in himſelf, to conceal a ſecret from his Friends, than to reveal it to them.</p>

               <head>THE HISTORY OF Lentulus.</head>
               <p>WHen I receiv'd the Emperors Orders to march the ſecond time againſt the <hi>Getes,</hi> and reduce them to their Obedience; he conſider'd this Expedition, as a Work only of ſome few Months: and I aſſure you, I my ſelf thought it not of that importance, as the ſequel declar'd it. I was acquainted with the manner of fighting, the milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Laws and Stratagems of that People: This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience gave me great advantages over them. Their Revolt was yet ſo young, and ſo newly crept out of the ſhell of Sedition, that it wanted growth and age to eſtabliſh it with firmity; and the Troops, which <hi>Caeſar</hi> committed to my conduct, were all of choice and ſelect men. In the mean while the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inexpugnable obſtinacy of this Nation, gave me more trouble and laborious exerciſe, than I could have imagin'd: and prolong'd a War for two whole years, which I hop'd to have concluded in leſs than one Campagne. This repugnance provok'd me to thoſe acts of ſeverity, which my ordinary temper is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94435:22"/> naturally averſe from. I ſent away the chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of ſome of their Cities, to plant Colonies in the deſart Iſlands of the frozen Sea; and running a great danger of my life in an Encounter, from whence the <hi>Romans</hi> were forc'd to retire with loſs and diſhonor, I cull'd out of the Priſoners, we took, thoſe of the beſt ſhapes, and extraction amongſt them; and ſent them, as a Preſent, to the Officer, who had the charge of the Gladiators. This revenge was the moſt rigorous, that I could inflict upon thoſe obſtinate <hi>Getes:</hi> which tranſported them to that rage and deſpair, that a few dayes after I had taken this courſe, the Sentinels, who were plac'd round my Tent, took a young Man attempting to force his entrance into it, who being ſearch'd, was found to carry a dagger conceal'd about him. He was brought before me; when the firſt view I took of him, did not more ſurprize, than charm my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. He ſeem'd not to be above ſixteen, or ſeventeen years of age. His ſtature ſcarce reach'd the middle ſize of Men, and wanted the addition of ſome years to give it its juſt proportion: but yet it was noble and of generous deportment; and each action of his perſon did bear the ſtamp and character of a charming greatneſs. His firſt aſpect ſeem'd, by a ſecret Magic, to diſarm my reſolution of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, to the rage whereof, I was fully bent to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice him, and all, that bore the name of <hi>Gete.</hi> I ask'd him, with a great deal of ſweetneſs, what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign had brought him into my Camp? and for what intent he would have forc'd an entrance into my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion?</p>
               <p>To have kill'd thee, if it had been poſſible, reply'd the fierce Youth; my rage is too juſt, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own'd; and the only regret, which ſhall attend my
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94435:22"/> wretched life unto thoſe infamous tortures, to which I know, thy cruelty will ſoon expoſe it, is to outlive the effects of ſo glorious an attempt. Alas, my Friend, ſaid I, what injuſtice have I committed againſt thee, that ſhould inſpire thy fury with reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo barbarous and ſo criminal? Thou haſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd, ſaid he, againſt me, one of the moſt ſenſible acts of barbariſm, which was in thy power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute upon me; I am deſcended of a blood, that ought to be of ſome conſideration amongſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> Death depriv'd me of a Father and a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at an age, when I was only capable of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging one only Brother for all my Relations and Parents: and Barbarian, him thou haſt rob'd me of; and being inſenſible of the charms of that Youth, who was born with all the advantages, wherewith nature and education could accompliſh him, haſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly added him to the number of the Gladiators, for a worthy ſpectacle to entertain the effeminacy and cruelty of the Tyrant of <hi>Rome:</hi> and the firſt, perhaps, wherewith he deſigns to regale the luſts of the Adultreſs <hi>Livia,</hi> ſhall be exhibited at the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expence of my Brothers life. Oh ye gods, went he on, (whoſe fury this reflexion had inflam'd,) is it poſſible, that after an act of ſuch inhumanity, I ſhould tamely look upon thee with calmneſs, ſpeak to thee, and not revenge upon thy loathed perſon, the injury thou haſt perpetrated againſt the blood of <hi>Herennius?</hi> In pronouncing theſe laſt words, with a ſavage fury he would have darted himſelf in my face: which ſecond attempt, having turn'd the points of more than twenty javelins upon his breaſt, had ſoon receiv'd its due chaſtiſement, had not I interpos'd my ſelf betwixt him and the indiſcreet zeal of thoſe, that were ready at ſo many gaps to let
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94435:23"/> forth his deſperate life. I pretended, I would wheedle out of him ſome diſcoveries, which might concern my own ſafety; and I gave order, he ſhould be kept under a ſtrict Guard, in a Chamber near mine. This command wanted not an appearance of reaſon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not improbable, but that he might have ſome Complices: And ſuppoſing I had an intent to put him to death, it ought to be ſuch a death, as might ſtrike a terror, into all ſuch, as might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd with him in the ſame deſign. But theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations were not the Motives of my preſerving his life: another more unknown and ſecret inſtinct render'd it as dear to me, as my own. I was more ſurpriz'd, than he himſelf, when they preſented their Javelins to his throat; and if my voice had not been ſufficient to avert the danger, which threaten'd him, I think I ſhould have oppos'd my own breaſt for a buckler, to have defended his. When I found my ſelf alone, and enter'd into a ſerious reflexion upon the ſubject of theſe extravagant ſentiments, which ſo inſenſibly incroach'd upon my reaſon, I impeach'd it of weakneſs and effeminacy; and was ready to open my mouth a thouſand times, to give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to have an object, which with ſo infamous a diſtemper infected my judgment, remov'd out of the world by moſt exquiſite tortures, but I had never the power, to pronounce the ſentence, which hung upon my lips. Some <hi>Demon,</hi> or other enemy to my repoſe and glory, had charm'd my tongue, and allow'd me only the uſe of it, to give order to have the Criminal brought again to my preſence. I ſaid, and believ'd too at that time, that I had no other intent in cauſing him to be arraign'd before me, than by ſome curious queſtions, to extort an humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion from him: But as ſoon as I caſt my eyes upon
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94435:23"/> him, ſo ſudden a fear poſſeſt me, leſt he ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer like a deſperate and ſtubborn wretch, and by that obſtinacy provoke me to a neceſſity of inflicting death upon him even againſt my will, that I did not dare to propoſe one queſtion to him: I pretended generoſity; and told ſome Officers, whom the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this accident had brought to my Tent, that if the attempt of the <hi>Gete</hi> had aim'd at any of their perſons, he ſhould have receiv'd his due puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at the ſame Moment I had been made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it; but ſince it was only level'd at mine, I would willingly force my own reſentments to ſubſcribe to the ambition I had, to try all manner of wayes to conquer the rigor and obdurateneſs of that ſtiff Nation. We ought to make an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaid I, whether theſe People may not be more ſenſible of our generoſity, than ſeverity. I will give this young Fellow his life, reſtore to him his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, oblige him with Preſents, and ſend him away with his liberty, to proclaim amongſt his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that the <hi>Romans</hi> never exerciſe their rigor, but upon the obſtinate and incorrigible; and that when the fortune only of <hi>Mars</hi> renders them Maſters of their Enemies, they treat them, like Brothers. This opinion of mine found but few aſſenters amongſt them; and thoſe, who oppos'd it, were doubtleſs endu'd with moſt judgment and reaſon: But I did not propoſe it to them, as if I ask'd their advice in the caſe, but as if I had done them the favor to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it to them, as a reſolution already fix'd and eſtabliſh'd. I made a ſign to the Priſoner to draw nearer to me; who approaching, I exhorted him never to attempt baſe and indirect wayes, to revenge himſelf of his Enemies; and after a long diſcourſe, wherewith the ſtanders by ſeem'd to be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94435:24"/> more mov'd, than the ſullen <hi>Gete,</hi> I concluded by declaring to him, that I granted him a life, his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had forfeited, together with the liberty of his Brother.</p>
               <p>The Youth ſeem'd to be tranſported beyond him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a rapture of joy at this generous effect of my clemency; and caſting himſelf at my feet, with a ſtream of tears, (which ſeem'd even thorow my breaſt to have found a channel to convey themſelves to my heart) purling down his cheeks ah! <hi>Lentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> ſaid he, a Perſon truly worthy to bear the name of <hi>Roman;</hi> thou haſt this day purchas'd a fame, which ſhall make more Nations bow to the Sceptre of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> than thy moſt victorious Arms could ever pretend to. My Brother ſhall employ that life and honor, thou haſt here preſerv'd, to render himſelf worthy of thy matchleſs generoſity. As for my ſelf, I am only capable of offering up vows and oraiſons to Heaven for the augmentation of thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the preſervation of thy precious life. This hand the gods never ſhap'd for Sword or Lance, it was fury only that arm'd it; and to diſguiſe nothing from a Perſon, to whom I owe all, know I am a Woman, and that thou haſt preſerv'd the blood of a renowned <hi>Roman,</hi> in preſervation of my Brother, and my ſelf. Imagine in your thoughts the ſurprize, I was in, at this atteſtation: I had before a blind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to protect the life of that audacious Youth, but when this inclination ſaw it ſelf in a capacity to be own'd as a legitimate Love, it grew like a Giant, as I may ſay, in the Cradle, and in a Moment at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to that Maturity and Strength, that as no elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the Mouth of another was able to confute it, ſo none in my own, is capable to give it its due character. I haſtily rais'd the fair Counterfeit, I a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94435:24"/> thouſand times beg'd her pardon for the ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe had receiv'd both from me, and my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: The confuſion of my countenance and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, more clearly diſcover'd to her, what was agitated at the Counſel-Table of my heart, than the moſt flouriſhing Rhetorick, was able to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd. She ſoon perceiv'd it; and if I may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low credit to the aſſeveration of a Woman, a ſenſe of gratitude wrought the ſame effects in her fair Soul, as her beauty did in mine. I underſtood from her, that ſhe was call'd <hi>Herennia,</hi> and deſcended from that famous <hi>Herennius,</hi> who follow'd <hi>Sertorius</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> at the time of the Tyranous Reign of <hi>Sylla. Herennia</hi> was not the own proper daughter of that <hi>Herennius,</hi> ſhe was too young; but ſhe was the daughter of a ſon of that illuſtrious Proſcript: who, after his Fathers death, having ſcatter'd the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Relicks both of his own, and his Fathers wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Errors over moſt Parts of the Univerſe, at laſt fix'd his Reſidence amongſt the <hi>Getes;</hi> and had by a Lady, of an incomparable beauty, whom he had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous'd, this <hi>Herennia,</hi> and the young <hi>Herennius.</hi> They were Twins, and were left Orphans, almoſt as ſoon as they fell into the arms of the wide World; and had had their Education under a <hi>Roman,</hi> a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick of their Grandfather, who had inſtructed them in the Latine Tongue. Old <hi>Herennius</hi> did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Sertorius</hi> retire into the <hi>Baleare</hi> Iſlands, whither the Tutor to the two young In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants follow'd him, and there learn'd the Spaniſh Tongue, which he afterwards taught his Pupils. He was a great Maſter in divers Arts and Sciences, which were requiſite for the accompliſhment of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality; nor had he been a Niggard in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting them to the two <hi>Herennian</hi> Orphans; and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94435:25"/> finding them richly indu'd with natural capacities, had render'd them two Prodigies, of Learning, Wit and Education.</p>
               <p>Theſe things did ſhe recount to me with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent grace, and teſtifi'd an impatient deſire of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Native Countrey of her Anceſtors. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd her to conduct her thither, as ſoon as the War was ended; and ever after I caus'd her to be treated like a <hi>Roman</hi> of Quality, whoſe Renowned Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors Fortune had before as unjuſtly raviſh'd from, as now again it had miraculouſly reſtor'd to <hi>Italy.</hi> I re-inveſted her likewiſe in thoſe Lands, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to her in the Territories of the <hi>Getes;</hi> all which were then lately fallen into the power of the <hi>Romans:</hi> I made a diſtinction betwixt thoſe, and our other Conqueſts; and appointed certain Troops to guard them, as if they had been a part of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of the Empire. The young <hi>Herennius</hi> was ſet at liberty by the Captain of the Gladiators, and honor'd with ſuch Charges, as his age was capable of, in our Army; but he did not continue long in them, for he left the Camp by ſtealth, and ſince his departure, we could never gain any intelligence of him. The favors I confer'd upon <hi>Herennius,</hi> and thoſe wherewith I daily ſtudied to oblige his Siſter, did purchaſe me her entire good will, and as ſhe was of a candid integrity, and her intentions ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, ſhe made no ſcruple to declare to me, the real ſentiments ſhe had for me. That Summers <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania</hi> was drawing to an end, and my Troops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look towards their Winter-quarters; <hi>Heren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> made her ordinary Reſidence in a Houſe, not far diſtant from the Camp. I entertain'd all the leiſure my duty would permit me to ſteal from my charge, in her converſation: I promiſed you, ſaid ſhe to me
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94435:25"/> one day, if you remember, only oraiſons and vows in exchange, for the life you gave me, and the liberty you promis'd my Brother: And ſince your genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity has not confin'd it ſelf to the limits of your bare word, my gratitude thinks it ſelf oblig'd too, not to contain it ſelf within the bounds of a ſingle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment; I challenge, methinks, a more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible intereſt in all that relates to you, than a bare ſenſe of a favor is capable of producing. I ought to pay you a reſpect, as to the General of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and though I had no other intereſt in your Concerns, than what the Memory of the Obligations I owe you begets in me, your preſervation and felicity ought to be held by me in the ſame rank with mine own: But when I conſider you within the reach of any danger, thoſe Obligations preſent themſelves no more to my thoughts, but the preſervation only of the perſon of <hi>Lentulus,</hi> which I prefer before the devoir of an acknowledgment; and if intereſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you to act, as you have done, you ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent your ſelf, that you have oblig'd me: for, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, the ſenſe of your favors, have no alliance at all with the ſentiments, I find in my breaſt for you.</p>
               <p>O! Adorable <hi>Herennia,</hi> cry'd I, may you ever forget in that manner the Obligations, for which you think your ſelf redevable to me: they are but acts of juſtice, which merit not a place in your thoughts, and can only charge me with the praiſe of having perform'd my devoir: But may you ever, ever remember, that <hi>Lentulus</hi> adores you; that the terrible ſhape, wherein you firſt preſented your ſelf to his view, could not defend his heart againſt the effects of your charms; and that he ſhall love you to the laſt Moment of his Life with a Paſſion, no Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94435:26"/> heart was ever yet capable of. That which you would have me forget, ſaid <hi>Herennia</hi> interrupting me, ought perhaps with more Reaſon to challenge a place in my Memory, than that which you deſire I ſhould retein. You have effectually ſnatch'd me out of the jaws of death, into which my fury would have precipitated me: the Liberty of my Brother, is an eſſential favor; the Obligations, you have heap'd upon me, are real Obligations, and your Love, perhaps, may not have the ſame ſolidity: It is a <hi>Chimera,</hi> which time will diſſipate without your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; but yet by a Magick, which my ſtrongeſt Reſolutions cannot conquer, this <hi>Chimera</hi> charms my Soul with a more real delight, than a Verity would do of more importance. There is no neceſſity that I ſhould farther enlarge my ſelf upon this ſubject, added <hi>Lentulus,</hi> the indifferent <hi>Hortenſius</hi> will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with a more tedious recital of ſuch delicate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; and the Amorous <hi>Ovid</hi> comprehends as well as my ſelf, the Raptures they infus'd into my Soul, which did banquet upon them in all peace and tranquility, till <hi>Tiberius</hi> came like an intruding Gueſt, and intrench'd upon the bounds of my feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: He envy'd the credit and favor of <hi>Marcellus;</hi> and the prudent <hi>Livia</hi> fearing the ill conſequences of his Malice, had perſuaded the Emperor to diſpatch him away towards me, with ſome new Levies he had made, to reinforce the <hi>Getiſh</hi> War; the Orders of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> were nothing different from thoſe, I had receiv'd from <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and it appear'd by the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> was ſent to me rather as a Collegue, than a General: But I in him regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Son of an ambitious Empreſs, and without any repugnance reſign'd to him the honor of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Command; which he manag'd at firſt with
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94435:26"/> moderation enough. And if the attempt of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennia</hi> had never been known to him, I believe we might have at this hour held a fair correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence together: but the report of it being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd to him, by one of thoſe Tale-brokers which follow Camps, as well as Courts, he conſider'd it as an Adventure ſo ſingular and admirable, that he would needs ſee her. A ſecret preſage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my Soul rendred this curioſity ſuſpected to it; I endeavour'd to divert it with all the arguments my jealouſie ſuggeſted to me but being able to frame none, but what his obſtinacy was reſolved to confute. <hi>Tiberius</hi> would not be convinc'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor could I excuſe my ſelf from conducting him to the houſe were ſhe was.</p>
               <p>I will declare ſo much in the honor of the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Herennia;</hi> ſhe obſerv'd thoſe precautions in all her actions before him, that I could not have exacted from her. She ſuppreſt part of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural vivacity of her Spirit, and only ſuffer'd him to diſcover, what was impoſſible for her to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe from him; whilſt her deportment was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diveſted of that gaity and all which gave it at other times a moſt charming grace: her regards were modeſt and conſtrain'd: in a word, <hi>Hiren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> that offer'd her ſelf then to the eyes of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> was not the ſame <hi>Herennia,</hi> that in our private Converſe us'd to preſent her ſelf to mine; but yet though ſhe affected to appear ſo wholly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd from her ſelf, ſhe had not the power not to charm <hi>Tiberius.</hi> This Prince is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſſemblers in the Univerſe; for a while he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd his thought; but perceiving, in ſome viſits he afterwards made to <hi>Herennia,</hi> that I had a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for her, and ſhe ſome appearance of good will
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94435:27"/> for me, his jealouſie for that time became his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and tranſported him beyond the Politicks of his diſſimulation; you have taken your leave of a fair opportunity, ſaid he to me one day, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your court to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> by giving liberty to a Daughter of the <hi>Herennius's;</hi> you might have made a onſiderable Preſent to the Emperor in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Slave; and if you will beſtow her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to make one to the Empreſs, you ſhall in exchange command any thing of me, that lies in my power to oblige you. I Sir, cry'd I, all ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, Can I deliver up to you, in the quality of a Slave, a young Daughter of the Blood of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennius?</hi> Oh Sir! ſaid I, are you ignorant of the Prerogatives which like ſo many Gems in an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Diadem, incircle the glorious name of a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? Herennia</hi> is your Compatriot as well as mine; if the Caprice of fortune has for ſome time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd her of the advantages her birth gave her, it could not deprive her of the Rights of it: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of rendring a ſervice to the Emperor, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>Herennia</hi> in ſlavery, I am convinc'd, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> would enter into Arms to protect her from it, if any one ſhould be ſo preſumptuous as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to impoſe unworthy Chains upon her liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Blood of <hi>Herennius,</hi> reply'd <hi>Tyberius,</hi> is not ſo recommmendable to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as you ſeem to perſuade your ſelf: he was one of thoſe Rebels diſguiſed, who under pretence of eſtabliſhing <hi>Rome</hi> in a liberty which ſhe is too fortunate to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited now to ſo glorious a Change, did miſerably dilaniate the State by their diviſions; and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed the chief of the <hi>Roman</hi> Nobility to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Luſts and Intereſts. The perſons you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Sir, ſaid I, were never branded with that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94435:27"/> Title, but by the enemies of the publick Liberty. None dare deny but that the Reign of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ought to be preferr'd before that Liberty, which <hi>Sertorius</hi> and the Grandfather of <hi>Herennia</hi> did with ſuch pertinacy defend. But Sir, when they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves the Protectors of it, it was not <hi>Caeſar</hi> that invaded it. And I doubt not but they would have unanimouſly deferr'd it to the high merit of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> what they diſputed with the tyrannous ambition of <hi>Sylla:</hi> And though <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them no otherwiſe than as the ſecond cauſes, which Heaven employ'd to wreſt the Empire out of the hands of a bloody <hi>Marius,</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> to conſerve it for the <hi>Caeſarian</hi> Race, I aſſure my ſelf he would have no diſ-eſteem for their memory.</p>
               <p>The Emperor has too much reaſon, reply'd <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> not to entertain a juſt reſentment for all ſuch, as oppos'd the eſtabliſhment of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Power; he is ſenſible that the ſame perſons, who ran counter to the deſigns of <hi>Sylla,</hi> would have gloried to have been the Aſſaſſins of the Great <hi>Julius,</hi> had they lived in his Age. They were a company of opiniatre and ambitious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who judging that the World could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſufficient merit in them to elevate them to the Throne of Sovereign Authority, would like ſo many bloody Anatomiſts, diſſect it into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of parts, that each one might poſſeſs a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd Empire for his ſhare. The perſon of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> or that of <hi>Sylla,</hi> or that of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> would have challeng'd the ſame Rank in their levelling thoughts. It is a Maxime of State to deſtroy all the young Sciens of that Seditious Race: If <hi>Heren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> had been the only remaining Branch of the rebellious Stock of <hi>Herennius,</hi> ſomething might
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94435:28"/> have been allow'd to her Sex; but ſhe has a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who has lately by a ſurreptitious attempt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd himſelf out of the reach of our Power; and therefore is but juſtice, that his Siſter ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a Pledge for him; and if you perſiſt in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

I impos'd a great conſtraint upon my ſelf, to avoid an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of that importance; and proteſting that the Perſon of <hi>Herennia</hi> was wholly indifferent to me, I only repreſented to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that he ought to conſult the opinion of the chief Officers, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the regard due to the ſacred name of a <hi>Roman. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> readily aſſented to this propoſition: he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, but that the title of the Son of <hi>Livia</hi> would captivate the ſuffrages of the whole Council to his own deſires. And to ſpeak the truth, the credit of the Empreſs was ſo formidable to the greateſt part of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had perhaps ſucceeded in his deſign, had I allow'd him the leiſure to proceed in it. I went the ſame night to <hi>Herennia,</hi> and giving her a brief account of what had happen'd, I poſſeſt her with ſuch an horror of <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s intentions, that ſhe proteſted to me, ſhe was reſolv'd to run all hazards, to conſerve her liberty. I provided her a faithful guide, a Captain of a Cohort, in whom I could repoſe at entire confidence; to him I committed her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; and allowing her only one of her Relations to accompany her, who was deſirous to ſhare in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94435:28"/> her fortune, I convey'd her into this Iſland, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend here under the name of <hi>Roſelina,</hi> a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable deſtiny, than that the <hi>Getiſh</hi> Camp pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her.</p>
               <p>How, ſaid <hi>Ovid,</hi> interrupting <hi>Lentulus,</hi> is <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelina</hi> that ſame <hi>Herennia,</hi> whoſe Hiſtory you here recount to us? And is it <hi>Roſelina,</hi> of whoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, you ſo confidently aſſure your ſelf?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſelina,</hi> reply'd <hi>Lentulus,</hi> is the very ſame perſon, who captivated my affections, the firſt minute I beheld her under the name of <hi>Herennia,</hi> and ſhall command them to the laſt moment of my life, under what title ſoever ſhe ſhall be pleas'd to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor the World with her diſguiſe: But oh! ye gods, ſhe is now no longer that <hi>Herennia,</hi> from whom amongſt the <hi>Getes</hi> I receiv'd ſuch tender demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of her affection. <hi>Tiberius</hi> was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed of the departure of our Fugitives, but when it was not poſſible for him to retrieve them: which tranſported him to the higheſt degree of rage; but thinking it ſafe for him directly to attack my Perſon, which he knew was in good eſteem with the Soldiery, he vented his fury upon ſome of the Cavalry, whom I had made choice of for her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy. He laid to their charge the Crime of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, and proceeded againſt them as Criminals convicted. I vigorouſly oppos'd my ſelf againſt a courſe of ſo much injuſtice, and declar'd, that they had not left the Camp, but by my leave. This it was, which gave him a fair ope at me, as he imagin'd: whereupon he publiſhed a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance againſt my Conduct; charg'd me with hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intelligence with ſome principal <hi>Getes,</hi> impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the protraction of the War to the private em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys, upon which I put the Imperial Forces, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94435:29"/> diſpatching away his accuſations to the Emperor, he engag'd the credit of <hi>Livia</hi> ſo powerfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> cauſed me to be cited before the Senate, to render an account of my proceedings. The whole Army can teſtifie my fidelity; and though the reduction of the <hi>Getes</hi> requir'd more time than I at firſt apprehended, yet the ſervices I perform'd againſt thoſe Rebels, are not perhaps unworthy that reputation the World does flatter me with: But the favor of <hi>Livia</hi> was not to be ballanced, either with evidence, or juſtice. I left the Camp, as if I had addreſt my journy towards <hi>Rome;</hi> but as it is never ſafe for a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to lay his head at the foot of his Sovereign, neither was it any longer in my power, to live without the ſight of <hi>Herennia,</hi> I reſolv'd to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all the time my friends judg'd neceſſary for the quallifying the indignation of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to my charming Amour. <hi>Cepion</hi> only, who is my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular friend, is acquainted with the place of my retreat: he remains ſtill in the Camp, from whence he advertiſes me, of what is acted againſt my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt there; and by a Correſpondent which I have at <hi>Lesbos,</hi> I receive certain intelligence what ſtate my affairs are in at <hi>Rome.</hi> The reception I have hitherto received from <hi>Roſelina,</hi> has been conformable to the Sentiments I have always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in <hi>Herennia;</hi> till ſome few days ſince, I was ſenſible of an alteration. I have two or three times ſurpriſed her reading ſome Love-verſes, whereof ſhe refuſed to diſcover the Author. She has daily ſome ſecret or other to impart to <hi>Junia,</hi> wherein ſhe will not do me the honor to be her Confident. The night before yeſterday, a little after your arrival, ſhe dropt ſome Tablets, filled
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94435:29"/> with the amorous Complaints of a Heart, forc'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to render it ſelf to the violence of an imperious Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſhe found me peruſing them; and perceiving they gave me a ſenſible diſquiet, inſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to calm it, ſhe ſtrove to laugh me out of it, and told me with a brisk air in her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance (which had almoſt plung'd me into the deepeſt precipice of deſpair) that the aſſurance of a reciprocal love, tranſported Lovers into an <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium</hi> of Joy and Content; and that it was no ſmall ſatisfaction to her, to ſee that mine was capable of fear and apprehenſion. When I deſired her to inform me who it was, that Preſented her with thoſe amorous Lines, I daily obſerv'd in her hands; ſhe anſwered me, I was too inquiſitive, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting that ſhe could not impart the Secret to me, without rendring her ſelf unworthy of my eſteem, ſhe always tyrannically treats me with a ſcornful reſerve, Yeſterday, when I came to inform the Company, what I had learnt from the mouths of the Muſicians themſelves, ſhe caſt her eyes upon <hi>Junia:</hi> when preſently with their wanton ſmiles they began a Dialogue betwixt each other, in a language none could interpret but themſelves: I perceiv'd they made a rallery of my error, and underſtood by ſome broken words they whiſper'd to each other, that that Muſical Conſort included a Myſtery, we were ignorant of. I am doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs betray'd; <hi>Roſelina</hi> is inconſtant; but oh! I know not upon whom to fix the ſuſpition of her infidelity. I ſee no perſon in this Iſland, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the character of my Rival. <hi>Tiſienus</hi> is an ambitious Reſerve, whoſe proceedings pretend to no conformity with the effects of Love. <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> is a declar'd Enemy to that Paſſion. <hi>Ovid,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:94435:30"/> whom I ſhould fear more than all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, has been embarkt but two days in this our Society. All others who inhabit this wild Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, are either employed in concerns of another nature, or elſe not worthy to have any with <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelina;</hi> yet in the mean time there is ſome perſon, or other within it, whom ſhe affects. I have a Rival, but cannot find him; and the more trouble I give my ſelf to diſcover him, the more conceall'd he remains from me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ovid,</hi> with a great deal of delight gave ear to the complaints of <hi>Lentulus,</hi> he doubted not, but that he himſelf was the ſecret cauſe of this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Roſelina,</hi> and tickling his imagination with the pleaſing fancy of being made the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his Rival, there was no kind of malitious queſtion, wherewith, as with a picquant ſauce, he did not endeavor to ſeaſon the Banquet, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as he thought, had prepar'd to regale his wanton palate. But, ſaid he to <hi>Lentulus,</hi> do not ſuffer your ſelf to be abus d by a groundleſs nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Roſelina</hi> is perhaps the ſame perſon here, as <hi>Herennia</hi> was amongſt the <hi>Getes:</hi> It is nothing, but a caprice of jealouſie, which preſents her now to your thought in another ſhape. Oh! cry'd <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus,</hi> I am neither jealous, nor capricious; I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd ſo ſweet a ſatisfaction in the thoughts of being lov'd by <hi>Herennia,</hi> that if my heart had cauſe to fear a ſurprize, it would have been from too great a confidence, not a groundleſs jealouſie, of the affections of the divine <hi>Roſelina.</hi> I have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to ſuffer my ſelf to be deceived, and was willing that ſhe ſhould put the cheat upon me; but the ingrateful One will not afford me the pity to be cheated by her. I met her yeſterday coming
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94435:30"/> forth of an artificial Wilderneſs, which is in this Iſland, and which doubtleſs (ſaid he, looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ovid</hi>) you have not yet had the time to viſits ſhe held ſome Papers in her hand, wherein I ſaw her read ſomething; I askt her what it was: ſhe might, if ſhe had pleaſed, have anſwered, that it was a trifle not worth my peruſal; for the leaſt ſyllable ſhe could have pronounc'd, might have challeng'd an abſolute authority over my Soul, and I never found my ſelf more diſpos'd, than at that time, to give credit to what ſhe ſaid: but ſhe told me laughing, that it was a Miſtery of Love, which ſhe could not then explain to me; and leaving me ſuddenly, ſhe gave me cauſe to apprehend, that ſhe had ſome affairs in hand, which were to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before the obligation of giving me ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Have you not perceiv'd heretofore, ſaid <hi>Ovid,</hi> that her levity has been guilty of any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant or chimerical Paſſion? Hiſtory informs us, that a certain Lady became enamour'd of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> only upon the fame and reputation of his great Actions, and ſacrific'd the life of her Husband to this frenzie. Men of this age are fram'd of the ſame Ingredients which compos'd thoſe of the former; and the imbecilities as well of the one Sex, as the other, which were practis'd in the time of <hi>Alexander,</hi> may deſcend to the Reign of <hi>Auguſtus. Herennia</hi> has a ſolid Judgment, reply'd <hi>Lentulus,</hi> and a Soul above thoſe Chimera's: which ſhe rarely applies to the cultivating of her Beauty, that care ſhe caſts aſide amongſt the moſt unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded pieces of her curioſity; and the ordinary affectations of other women, attract her contempt, not eſteem: And though I am ſenſible that ſhe once affected me with a Paſſion full of ardor and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94435:31"/> ſincerity, yet my moſt paſſionate endeavors were never able to debauch it to the leaſt degree of levity, or weakneſs. A Soul of this temper is ſcarce ſuſceptible of the impreſſions of an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar imagination. But, added he, checking himſelf ſuddenly, your diſcourſe recalls to my memory, that ſome days ſince, ſpeaking of the extravagant effects of Love, ſhe maintained it might take birth in a heart, and be inflam'd of an object it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw; and that ſhe could alledge an example of what ſhe aſſerted: And may not ſhe be that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample her ſelf? Oh! ye gods, Can it be poſſible, that a heart of ſuch proof againſt the attacks of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> ſhould ſuffer it ſelf to be ſeduc'd by the flatteries of a Rhiming Sophiſter? The arrival of <hi>Tiſienus,</hi> prevented <hi>Ovid</hi> from proceeding farther in his malitious deſign: there had been no great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence betwixt him and <hi>Tiſienus,</hi> whilſt they were in <hi>Rome;</hi> but people of the ſame Country willingly conſort together, when they meet in a ſtrange Climate. <hi>Tiſienus</hi> had not been inform'd of the cauſe of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s diſgrace, but by the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of perſons of bad intelligence: he thought that the too eminent favor of <hi>Terentia</hi> had drawn it upon him; and whereas <hi>Mecoenas</hi> had diſcovered the Conſpiracy of <hi>Marcus Lepidus,</hi> in which <hi>Tiſienus</hi> was involv'd, he had no good thoughts for that worthy Favorite. He would ſeem in a Satyrical Note to deplore his misfortune, in having ſo unfaithful a Wife; Muſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> have Partners, ſaid he, in the Empire of Love? It is glorious for a Subject to ſhare ſtakes in any thing, with his Sovereign; but for <hi>Craſſus,</hi> for <hi>Ovid,</hi> and perhaps for ſome body elſe too; when a heart has made the firſt ſtep upon the courſe of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94435:31"/> this gallantry, it ſeldom ſtops in ſo fair a road. To ſpeak the truth, this is to put the Philoſophy of <hi>Mecoenas</hi> to too ſevere a Teſt; I wonder that a Man of ſo powerful a credit, does not cauſe a new Tribunal to be erected, for the Trial of the bold Uſurpers of Matrimonial Rights. This rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery was very pleaſant in the mouth of <hi>Tiſienus: Ovid</hi> was ſo much taken with it, that he could not ſuffer it to paſs without a repartee. Husbands, ſaid he, whoſe Merits, might claim oftentimes chaſter Wives, than Heaven has join'd them to, owe grand obligations to you, for the charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble complaints, you make of their misfortunes. A perſon ought to be aſſur'd of the virtue of his own Wife, who ſo freely gloſſes upon another; and if you were not convinc'd of the fidelity of <hi>Sulpicia,</hi> you would not ſo liberally attack that of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia.</hi> I muſt confeſs, reply'd <hi>Tiſienus,</hi> that I am out of the reach of out of thoſe forked Darts my ſelf, which I level at the Brows of others; for <hi>Sulpicia,</hi> thanks to the heavens, is endued with a Virtue, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable to all attempts; but though I were my ſelf in the ſame predicament with <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> I could not forbear to rally at the adventure of ſo eminent a Politician. That grand Statesman, whoſe vigilance, like the Monoculus of the World, at one view compriſes the Empire of the Univerſe, who with a perſpicacious and faithful inſpection, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates into the ſecrets of Hearts; and diſcovers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies againſt <hi>Coeſar,</hi> before they are <hi>in Rerum Naturâ,</hi> is inſenſible of thoſe which are daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt himſelf: he ſleeps in a high ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when he ought to awake for the defence of his own Honor; and wakes with an indefatigable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, to terminate the affairs of <hi>Illiria.</hi> That is,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94435:32"/> reply'd <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> becauſe he is convinc'd, that a man ſhould wake in vain, to divert a woman, from what ſhe is reſolv'd to do. The care and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance <hi>Mecoenas</hi> dedicates to the <hi>Illirian</hi> War, may perhaps be crown'd with a glorious ſucceſs; but had he as many Spies, as <hi>Argus</hi> Eyes, he could not prevent the fortune his Wife threatned him with when ſhe had once deſigned it in her pleaſing ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. I am not convinc'd with what you ſay, reply'd <hi>Tiſienus,</hi> the care of a Husband contributes much to the prudent conduct of a Wife: when he carries a vigilant eye over his Family; confines the exorbitant deſires of a young perſon within the bounds of moderation; obliges her to be at home at good hours; weans her with prudence and ſweetneſs from ſuch company, as may corrupt her innocence: By this means a man may diſſolve the Gordian Knot of all ill habits; and placing only before the eyes of her curioſity a Mirror of good example, preſerve her frailty from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of all diſhonorable condeſcenſions and lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>Behold, ſaid <hi>Ovid,</hi> with a grave look, the fair documents <hi>Tiſienus</hi> has us'd to make his fair Wife ſo great a Tygreſs as ſhe is. I thought that ſhe had ow'd her virtue to the excellence of her tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but now I perceive by the Maxims <hi>Tiſienus</hi> delivers us, that ſhe derives it from another ſource; and doubtleſs ſhe would not be what ſhe is, had ſhe not had a perſon of ſuch excellent Principles to her Husband. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was ſcarce able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf from burſting forth into an open laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at this reply of <hi>Ovid;</hi> and fearing he ſhould not be able to be the Maſter of himſelf, if the Converſe continued any longer, he made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94435:32"/> to them, to go and take a walk in a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Garden he had lately made. The Iſle of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſia</hi> was not ſo populous, as many others, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Egean</hi> Sea is enricht: yet it was not wholly deſtitute of neceſſaries for the ſupport of humane life. The neighborhood of <hi>Lesbos</hi> did fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it with all ſorts of skilful Artificers, and <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius,</hi> had employed them, to charm the tedious hours of his Exile: his houſe, though Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built, was uniform and regular, and many arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Walks, form'd with an elaborate curiſioty, which encompaſſed it, ſeemed to correct the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural wildeneſs of the ſituation.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was entertaining the three <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> with the Beauty of his little <hi>Thalaſſian</hi> Villa; <hi>Roſelina,</hi> who naturally affected company, being diſſatisfied with their long abſence, made a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal to her fair Companions to go and ſurprize them, where they were. <hi>Junia</hi> expreſſed a coyneſs at the motion, for fear it might blemiſh her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty. But <hi>Roſelina</hi> calling her a formal imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and telling her ſhe would take upon her ſelf the boldneſs of the Viſit, took the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Lepidus</hi> in one hand, and <hi>Adiamante</hi> in the other, and drew them after her towards <hi>Hortenſius</hi> his Garden. He was then buſie in ſhowing his friends ſome rare Simples, which an <hi>Arab,</hi> who paſt by <hi>Thalaſſia,</hi> had made him a preſent of. Theſe Plants grew within a private ſquare; and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> who went to advertiſe their Maſter of the Ladies arrival, forgot to look there for him: they haſtily run over all the Walks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined each corner of a Grove of Fir-trees, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they all center'd; and believing that <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was gone out at another door, which open'd towards
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94435:33"/> the Lake, they came and gave this imaginary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to the three Ladies; they were not much concerned at it, for they had found an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to divertiſe themſelves in the place, where they were; which was the Room where <hi>Ovid</hi> was lodged: he had forgot to ſhut a little Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, which ſtood upon the Table; and their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity invited them, to take an Inventory of what was in it: The firſt thing they laid their hands upon, was a Picture of <hi>Julia,</hi> wherein ſhe was Pourtrated under the Figure of <hi>Venus.</hi> A little Love god was preſenting a great number of Hearts to her; and the Goddeſs was weaving Chains with the Treſſes of her Hair, to captive them; ſome Links whereof, which ſeem'd by their color to be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd from that fair <hi>Venus,</hi> ſerv'd inſtead of a Ribon, to hang a rich Carkanet of Hearts at, which were ſet within a ſparkling Caſe of Carbuncles; round the Borders whereof, a glorious Deviſe was engraven. Many Letters of different Characters were in the ſame Drawer with this Picture, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelina</hi> open'd one, and read it.
<q>When I could not comprehend, how there could be a diviſion in your Adorations and your Deſires, I was ignorant of the intention of thoſe unuſual Sacrifices: I thought you had only offer'd to my ſincere Paſſion a ſlight one of roving Thoughts, which like wandring Pilgrims, made every Saint the object of their devotion, and wherein each common Goddeſs, might claim a ſhare as well as <hi>Sulpicia;</hi> which fluttering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad into every place upon the wings of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, or Complaiſance, are rather Antidotes againſt Love, than a ſovereign Cordial for it.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94435:33"/> But I muſt now confeſs, I have committed an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice both againſt your tranſports &amp; my own charms. Offer up your adorations daily to the Princeſs; charm her with your tender and delicate diſcourſes; dedicate the raptures of your Muſe to her Shrine, and ſtill make love to <hi>Sulpicia,</hi> in the manner you have begun; I ſhall not impeach the diviſion you make in your addreſſes, of infidelity; for I have ſo firm an aſſurance of your integrity, that I perſuade my ſelf <hi>Julia</hi> will have the greateſt cauſe to complain of it.</q>

               <p>This is an admirable piece of Courtſhip of <hi>Ovid</hi> to our Sex, ſaid <hi>Roſelina,</hi> when <hi>Junia</hi> had read out the Verſes, to impute all his own crimes to us, and not to be ſatisfi'd only to betray us, unleſs he likewiſe render'd us guilty of his own treaſons. Is not this kind of injuſtice, reply'd <hi>Junia,</hi> common to all men? They love by fancy, and change through levity. When they have made us the ſubject of their inconſtancy, and perceive that our juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation looks with a ſcornful eye of a regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs inſenſibility upon their treacheries, they preſently
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94435:34"/> ſlander it with the title of levity, or infidelity; and ſeem to accuſe us for plucking ſome laurels from their triumphs, when we gain ſo glorious a conqueſt over our ſelves, as not to deplore our misfortunes. And as if it were too little for us to be deſpis'd, to inhance their vanity, the Ingrates envy us even the ſlight ſatisfaction of concealing from the Publick, the effects of their inhumanity. It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, ſaid <hi>Roſelina,</hi> caſting up her eyes to Heaven, that this wicked kind of creature, Man, is an enemy to our repoſe; but ſuch as they are, we have a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclination, to wiſh them better, than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. Experience has many Ages labor'd in vain to infuſe wiſdom into us; the Examples of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Women trepan'd, proves no caution to us, not to expoſe our weakneſs to the like danger; and he that ſhould bring us all to our Affidavits, would find, that we had rather run the hazard, of being deceiv'd ten times over in our lives, than to be debar'd from the converſe of thoſe Infidels. Whil'ſt <hi>Junia</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelina</hi> were diſcourſing, <hi>Adiamante</hi> was buſie in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining all the Avenues of the Cabinet: ſhe found there Verſes of different meaſures, and characters; and an Elegy, which ſhe laid aſide, becauſe ſhe could not underſtand it; ſhe alſo encounter'd with a noted Song, and amongſt all this, ſome fragments of that famous piece, intituled, <hi>The Goddeſs of Hearts,</hi> which <hi>Ovid</hi> mention'd in his own Hiſtory. <hi>Roſeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s eye was upon <hi>Adiamante,</hi> when ſhe open'd the Papers, and taking that, out of her hand, wherein thoſe fragments were contain'd, ſhe found, it began in this manner.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94435:36"/> Charms captivate the heart of one of the greateſt Princes of the World. I know not what <hi>Roſelina</hi> thinks of what you ſay, reply'd <hi>Junia,</hi> but as to my ſelf, the ſatisfaction of enjoying the company of the famous <hi>Ovid,</hi> ſeems to merit a preference before all thoſe ſplendid diverſions, wherewith you would flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my vanity. I never had yet any experience, what pleaſure the dignity of <hi>Lepidus</hi> could afford me; I came not into the World, till after he had made his retreat out of it; nor was I ever acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ancient ſplendor of our Family, but by the loud report the World gives of it. But with what regard ſoever I conſider the luſtre of it, there's nothing in it, that offers it ſelf to my Ambition, which I ſhould not be ready to ſacrifice to the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I find in your converſe.</p>
               <p>Oh! Madam, ſaid <hi>Ovid,</hi> now I perceive my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is not ſo agreeable to you, as you declare; if it were, you would not be ſo prodigal in ſcattering thoſe flowers upon me, which with their flatteries have ſealed up my lips; I dare no longer regard you, no longer diſcourſe you; the too meritorious expreſſions, you have pronounc'd in my favor, have involv'd me in a confuſion, which muſt render me a Mute for ever in your preſence. I will be her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voucher, reply'd <hi>Roſelina</hi> interrupting him, that no expreſſion of hers, has ſcatter'd a flattery upon you; and that the deſire to ſee you, has not of late uſurp'd the laſt place in her ambition; and I can teſtifie, that one of the chiefeſt regrets; which invaded her, at the fall of her illuſtrious houſe, took its birth from the impoſſibility ſhe conceiv'd, of ever ſeeing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Ovid,</hi> but at the Court of <hi>Caeſar. Ovid</hi> was ſurpriz'd at this teſtimony of <hi>Roſelina;</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that he had heard almoſt the ſame words,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94435:36"/> at the private Colloquy, he had not long before been a ſtolen witneſs to; but he attributed them to the daughter of <hi>Herennius,</hi> though they might as well ſuit with that of <hi>Lepidus.</hi> They were both of <hi>Roman</hi> extraction; both had cauſe to deplore the ruine of a Noble Family, and both might have had an opportunity of ſeeing <hi>Ovid</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> had not the fatal deſtiny of their Parents expell'd them, and all their glories out of the remoteſt Territories of its Dominions.</p>
               <p>What you relate, Madam, ſaid he to <hi>Roſelina</hi> does not ſurprize me with its Novelty; a certain Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Genius, which alwayes prompts me with intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence relating to my deſtiny, inform'd me not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes ſince, that a beautiful Perſon did honor me with ſome good will, who never ſaw me, but did with impatience deſire to ſee me; and teſtify'd a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, very conſonant to thoſe, you have expreſs'd: But if my officious inteligencer has given me a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful account, this good effect of my Stars does not make its point towards <hi>Junia.</hi> The Familiar you ſpeak of, reply'd <hi>Junia</hi> ſmiling, has had his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry charg'd with ſuch variety of Hiſtorical Remarks, ſince he came to your ſervice, that it is no wonder, if he has confounded the circumſtances of ſome of them. Princeſſes, Lady-Favorites, Senators daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Courtezans, and Rural Beauties, have had the honor (and often too) in their turns, to be the objects of your gallantry. How can the little Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius then, who Regiſters all your happy Adventures, keep an exact account, think you, in a Maſs of ſuch confuſions? Whil'ſt <hi>Ovid</hi> and the Ladies were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting themſelves with ſuch like gallantries, <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> was giving Orders to his Family for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of his Noble Gueſts, who did his little
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94435:37"/> 
                  <hi>Villa</hi> ſo much honor; and <hi>Tiſienus</hi> was buſie in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing ſome of <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Odes,</hi> which he found upon the Table. Out curious Searchers of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, had replac'd what they had taken out of it, and ſhut it again with ſo much haſte and confuſion, that one of the Papers, which they had read, was left ſticking half in, half out, betwixt the ſhutters. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſienus,</hi> by accident, caſt his eye upon it, and without being perceiv'd by the company, drew it quite out. It was folded up like a Letter, and <hi>Tiſienus</hi> knew the Cabinet belong'd to <hi>Ovid,</hi> as having ſeen it at his firſt landing in the hand of one of his Slaves. He ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, it was a Letter from <hi>Terentia,</hi> but it had no ſuperſcription; which is the moſt uſual way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Billet <hi>Doux. Tiſienus</hi> thought he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred now a fair occaſion of exerciſing thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, he had long fomented againſt <hi>Mecoenas.</hi> He haſtily pocketed the Paper, with a reſolution to examine it in private; and had ſcarce diſpos'd of it out of ſight, when <hi>Hortenſius</hi> came into the room; he had prepar'd a Collation, as noble, as either the ſtraitneſs of the place or the time could allow, which he had order'd to be ſerv'd up in a Gallery, adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Ovid</hi>'s chamber, whither he invited the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>This Gallery was adorn'd with many excellent pieces, which repreſented the memorable Geſts of the moſt Renowned <hi>Grecian</hi> Heroes; you might there behold the triumph of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> over <hi>Ajax,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſpute of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Arms. That exultancy of joy, which attends a triumphant ſucceſs, was live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſs'd in the haughty meen of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes; Ajax,</hi> on the contrary, bore all the marks of a furious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, which wildly ſtared out at the wide caſements of his rowling eyes. His cheeks were ſwol'n big
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94435:37"/> with rage, his brows <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> clouded, as it were, with a ſullen Miſt, his eyes ſparkling, and unfetled: and at a diſtant proſpect in the ſame table, you might ſee him ſpend his revengeful fury upon a poor tame ſheep; whoſe innocence the ingenious Pencil had ſo lively expreſs'd, that you would have thought, you had heard her in a mournful accent implore your ſuccor, whil'ſt the butcherly <hi>Ajax</hi> tearing her bowels out of her body, did barbarouſly revenge upon this guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Animal, an outrage, it had never committed. Conſider, I pray, theſe illuſtrious Heroes ſaid <hi>Ovid,</hi> whom Antiquity has commended to us, for no leſs than illuſtrious Deitles. The refuſal of a dead Mans Arms, an adverſe ſucceſs of a combat, a ſlight check of fortune, a ſmall contradiction, depriv'd them at once both of judgment and ſenſe; and made them convert the points of their Swords upon their own breaſts; which they ſhould have turn'd upon their Enemies. I muſt confeſs, that the titles of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were pure has'd good cheap in thoſe dayes; and that the Demi-gods in the Fable were very happy, they enter'd the World before us; for few of them, I ſuppoſe, would have receiv'd from us the honors, our Forefathers ſo liberally entail'd upon them. See here a Man, ſaid <hi>Tiſienus,</hi> pointing to the Picture of <hi>Cymon,</hi> who, in what Age ſoever he had liv'd, would have attracted to himſelf the admiration of it. His bravery, his magnificence, and his virtue, was the wonder of all the precedent. And do you ſeriouſly believe, ſaid <hi>Ovid,</hi> interrupting him in an ironical tone, that this virtue, this bravery, this mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, was ſuch in effect, as Hiſtories report it. Thoſe, who chronicled the actions of theſe Heroes, were their own Countreymen; and the glory of their Countrey, was inſeparably annex'd to that of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94435:38"/> the Heroe, they would blazon; And the relation of their Jeſts was rather, an exerciſe of wit and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, than a ſincere and faithful Narration. But if we would take a clear proſpect of things, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what <hi>Greece</hi> was; it was divided into 10 or 12 Monarchies, and 5 or 6 Republicks. The taking of a Town had amongſt them the reputation of the conqueſt of a Kingdom; And a Man that was ſo brave, as to march half a ſcore Miles, to invade the Territory of his Neighbor; and by ſurprize, or force, ſack'd a ſmall Hamlet or Village, had preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the honor of a triumph and title of Conqueror, given him. The ſame Hyperboles did often like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe elevate their virtue to that admired height, you ſpeak of. <hi>Epuminondus</hi> was impeach'd before the Senate of <hi>Thebes,</hi> for giving the Government of <hi>Myoenas,</hi> contrary to the expreſs commands of the Republick, to young <hi>Caliſt benes</hi> his Favorite; and yet he was eſteem'd a Perſon of the greateſt virtue amongſt the <hi>Grecians.</hi> The <hi>Spartan</hi> Laws, which purchas'd ſuch a reputation to <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> contain more Precepts, relating to the eaſe and convenience of humane life, than the Libertines of <hi>Rome</hi> did ever practiſe. The chiefeſt care of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> was to make their Republick populous; and if a feeble and decrepid husband found himſelf overmatch'd in a young and ſprightly wife, he was oblig'd to provide a brisk Gallant for her, and own all the children of ſo excellent a commerce for legitimate, and of his own blood. You make us new Laws for <hi>Sparta,</hi> cry'd <hi>Tiſienus,</hi> this pernicious Maxim, was never yet eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in any civiliz'd Nation. What I have told you, reply'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> with a ſerious countenance, is a real truth; and the only inducement for me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the firſt <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> might with ſome
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94435:38"/> juſtice pretend to the title of the moſt wiſe and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Nation of the World. The Collation was brought in juſt as <hi>Ovid</hi> had pronounc'd theſe laſt words. If you will take my Advice, ſaid <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> as he was placing the Ladies, let us hearken no longer to this eloquent Sophiſter, he will impoſe a new ſenſe upon the beſt eſtabliſh'd Laws; and I know not whether he will not find out a way, ere it belong, by his ſubtle chymiſtry, to extract the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of a ſecret Paſſion, out of the indifferency, I profeſs. <hi>Ovid</hi> reſerv'd till another time, the liberty of making an Anſwer to his Friend; and ſeating himſelf next to <hi>Roſelina,</hi> he apply'd himſelf, during the repaſt, to take his meaſures from the regards of that fair one, and <hi>Junia,</hi> to diſcover, which of the two, was the Perſon, that had thoſe conceal'd incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations for him.</p>

                  <hi>TIſienus,</hi> with impatience, attended the end of the Collation, that he might have the freedom to read the Letter, he had drawn out of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Cabinet, which caus'd him to ſteal privately away from the Company; and going forth at the door, which open'd towards the Lake, he pull'd the Letter out of his Pocket, and fix'd his eye upon it with a curioſity, ſuitable to his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt <hi>Mecoenas:</hi> But he was ſtrangely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, when he beheld the hand and character of <hi>Sulpicia;</hi> he ragd, he rub'd his eyes as if there had been a Cloud, or thick Miſt, before them; he read, and read over again this terrible Letter, before he could be convinc'd of the truth of what he ſaw: but he found it one, ſtill as conſtant, as cruel. This Letter was the ſame, which <hi>Roſelina</hi> had read ſome hours before; and there was not a line, or ſcarce a word in it, which did not bring, or confirm, to the unfortunate <hi>Tiſienus,</hi> the moſt unpleaſing News his Stars could ſend him; that diſtinction of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and adorations, did aggravate the crime of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94435:39"/> 
                  <hi>Sulpicia.</hi> Oh! infamous Strumpet, cry'd <hi>Tiſienus,</hi> tranſported to the higheſt rage, no other Amour will ſatisfie her, than that ſhe robs another of! <hi>Ovid</hi> has not ſeduc'd her by any finery, or ſtratagem; but has engag'd her to be a ſecond to his Treaſon, without diſguiſing the leaſt circumſtance from her. From this Reflection, paſſing to that of the Argument, he had ſo lately held with the Paramour of his Wife, that malicious joy repreſented it ſelf to his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he thought <hi>Ovid</hi> might conceive, when he heard him ſpeak thoſe things of <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> which he might have apply'd to himſelf; eſpecially, when he expreſs'd ſuch a confidence of the virtue of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picia,</hi> before a perſon, who was able to have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced convincing proofs to the contrary. The Ironi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Repartees, wherewith <hi>Ovid</hi> retorted the Raileries <hi>Tiſienus</hi> had made upon <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> recurr'd word by word to his Memory. He ſhall dye, ſaid he, that infamous Inſtrument of my diſhonor, ſhall dye. <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus,</hi> who not long before had abſented himſelf from the Company, in <hi>Hortenſius</hi>'s Garden, happen'd to walk, to divert his Melancholy, near the place, where <hi>Tiſienus</hi> did form his fatal Reſolutions; he heard the ſentence, he had pronounc'd; he knew his voice, and fetching a tour about a ſmall plat of buſhes, which was betwixt them, Who is that, ſaid he, to <hi>Tiſienus,</hi> whom you have condemn'd to dye? Have you any Enemies in this Iſland? Or have you receiv'd any News lately, which gives you hopes, you may ſhortly have the ſatisfaction of exerciſing your Revenge, upon thoſe you have in <hi>Rome?</hi> I was Muſing, ſaid <hi>Tiſienus,</hi> (all in a confuſion,) upon a place of <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Iliads,</hi> and recollecting in my fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the words, which he makes <hi>Menelaus</hi> ſpeak, when <hi>Paris</hi> raviſh'd <hi>Helena</hi> from him, the force of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94435:40"/> my imagination caus'd me to break forth aloud into ſome of thoſe expreſſions. The Misfortune of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaus,</hi> reply'd <hi>Lentulus</hi> with a ſmile, ought to have made a ſtrong impreſſion upon your fancy, ſince it has made ſo great an alteration in your countenance, I believe it is rather a proſecution, of what you ſo lately deliver'd to us, upon the deſtiny of <hi>Mecoenas;</hi> you are ſenſible of the diſhonor of abuſed Husbands. The enraged <hi>Tiſienus</hi> finding theſe expreſſions gave a freſh alarum to his diſgrace, and not being able to ſtand his ground to receive a ſecond, left <hi>Lentulus</hi> abruptly; and directing his haſty ſteps towards his his own houſe, made ſuch a precipitate ſpeed in his walk, that <hi>Lentulus</hi> thought himſelf not oblig'd to follow him. His ſudden departure ſtruck him with admiration, he could not apprehend the cauſe of it; he knew <hi>Tiſienus</hi> had not been preſent at the recital, <hi>Ovid</hi> had made of his Love-adventures: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he took a reſolution to go and re-viſit <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> to inform himſelf if any thing had happen'd in his abſence, which had caus'd this diſorder in <hi>Tiſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> but he was prevented by one of his ſervants, who ſought him, and brought him ſome news, which caus'd him to return home in haſte; it came ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to favor <hi>Ovid</hi>'s deſigns. He led <hi>Roſelina,</hi> who with her Companions was taking a walk towards the Firr-tree Grove, and after he had diſcover'd to her the paſſage, he had been a private Witneſs to, at his firſt landing in <hi>Thalaſſia,</hi> the Adventure in the Labyrinth, and many other remarkable Encounters, ſhe was concern'd in, he endeavor'd to perſuade her, that he had, the firſt Moment he ſaw her, entertain'd a paſſion for her, not inferior to that, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd ſhe had allow'd a place to in her breaſt for him, before ever ſhe ſaw him.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:94435:40"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſelina</hi> was faithful as well to her Lover, as her Friend; and had no deſign to advantage herſelf by this Error of <hi>Ovid,</hi> but only as far as it might give her an innocent diverſion. Methinks, ſaid ſhe, you have reaſon to be ſatisfi'd with the hopeful progreſs, your Merit has already made; you have not been here above five or ſix dayes, and you are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that there are thoſe, who careſs you not in the meaneſt of their thoughts; you have written Love Verſes, which you are aſſur'd, have been read; and if it may oblige you, you may perhaps aſſure your ſelf too, that thoſe, who have read them, have taken pleaſure in reading them, and could wiſh, that they contain'd as much Sincerity, as Eloquence. What can your deſires aſpire to more? you muſt allow time to perfect the reſt. Time, reply'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> can claim no title to any Adventure, but where a heart is to be beſieg'd by the ſlow Approaches of long ſervices, and dull conſtancy; but when mutual ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy has already made the breach, and level'd all obſtacles, the firſt Moment, that Lovers ſee each other, ought to be the laſt of all diffidence and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity.</p>
               <p>How? ſaid <hi>Roſelina,</hi> Do you think it then a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo ſlight a conſequence, to wave all ſcruples in favor of a Lover, of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s temper? The Hiſtory of whoſe Life, is nothing but a contexture of Love Galantries; whoſe heart has been a Rover even from the Sceptre, to the Sheep-crook. What cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſecurity, would you give a Lady, that ſhe ſhould not be put into the Catalogue with <hi>Sulpicia, Virginia, Terentia, Julia,</hi> and many more. Oh! Madam, cry'd the brave <hi>Roman,</hi> I ſhall ask no more, whether it be your ſelf, or <hi>Junia,</hi> who honors me with the glory of ſome good wiſhes; you could not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94435:41"/> have been ſo well vers'd in the whole courſe of my life, had you not had a curioſity to be inſtructed in it; and I may with ſome juſtice preſume, that this curioſity is the Herald, to blazon that diſguis'd Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which I am aſſur'd a Lady of <hi>Thalaſſia</hi> had for me, before ſhe knew me. Whereupon being fully convinc'd that <hi>Roſelina</hi> was the Party, of whom he was affected, he ſpoke a thouſand tender and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate things, to obtain of her a private Interview. Love, is not capable of expreſſing it ſelf but by halves, ſaid he, before Witneſſes, grant mine, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, that liberty it ſtands in need of, to make its entire declaration; my tranſports ſhall give you the caution, you demand; which will expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch ardor, that it would be an injuſtice to you, to demand a farther ſecurity. It is either Fortune or Inconſtancy, which you ought to impute the multiplicity of my Intrigues too: I never had had but one in the whole ſeries of my life, if I had obey'd the natural inclinations of my heart; Pardon thoſe few extravagant courſes, which neceſſity for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it to take, and you ſhall not find it has been guilty of being common; it is the ſame it was, when the firſt Princeſs of the Univerſe did not diſdain the humble Sacrifices, it daily offer'd to her Divinity; And I hope, that becauſe it has been ſo much conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to Love, you will not allow it the leſs eſteem in your thoughts; ſince it will prove the glory of your Beauty, to triumph over ſuch multitudes of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Junia,</hi> who accompanied by <hi>Adiamante,</hi> and led by <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> followed <hi>Roſelina</hi> at a little diſtance, was ſomething concern'd at the long converſe, her Friend held with <hi>Ovid.</hi> Do you think, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Roſelina,</hi> that the Deſtinies have ſent <hi>Ovid</hi> into this
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94435:41"/> Iſland, for your converſation only? Can you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any Prerogative over him, more than others? And do you think it a piece of juſtice, to ingroſs him wholly to your ſelf, and allow us no ſhare in him?</p>
               <p>You muſt pardon the fault, reply'd <hi>Roſelina,</hi> if the Rules of Equity are forgotten, when <hi>Ovid</hi> is preſent; but I ſhall return to my Devoir, ſaid ſhe, making a ſtop, as ſoon as I am admoniſh'd of it; and I here reſign to you this noble Perſon, more complacent, and more agreeable, than I receiv'd him. Theſe laſt words did ſtrongly confirm the preſumptive hopes of our Illuſtrious Exile; he repeated them more than once, in his fancy; and could allow them no other interpretation, but what did flatter his deſires; and finding <hi>Roſelina</hi> moſt infinitely amiable, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, that the raptures her preſence inſpir'd him with, began inſenſibly to deface out of his Memory all the vaniſhing Idea's of the Court of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> The confidence, which <hi>Lentulus</hi> had teſtifi'd to him in acquainting him with his Engagements with <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennia,</hi> did ſometimes intrude a ſmall ſcruple amongſt his pleaſing tranſports: But, beſides that your Amoriſts by profeſſion are not very ſcrupulous in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching upon the borders of friendſhip, <hi>Ovid</hi> was not unfurniſh'd with reaſons, to authorize his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. He knew, a Lady in <hi>Thalaſſia</hi> had a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for him, before he knew <hi>Lentulus</hi> had one for <hi>Roſelina;</hi> it was no deſign in himſelf, but the capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of his Stars, which had render'd him his Rival; if his reputation had acquir'd him a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs, could he prevent it? Was there any obligation lay upon him, to ſacrifice this Miſtriſs, to the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a Friend, ſince he had never endeavor'd to force out of his Mouth the ſecret of his Love? And
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94435:42"/> ought he to refuſe this glorious Preſent Fortune now makes him, becauſe <hi>Lentulus</hi> is guilty of an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion? This reaſoning having imbroil'd the fancy of <hi>Ovid</hi> moſt part of the night, and at laſt calm'd thoſe ſtorms, (which he concluded a virtue out of ſeaſon had rais'd) he reſolv'd to bend all his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to the accompliſhing his deſires. He had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that from the Gallery, where the Collation was held the night before, there was a fair deſcent by a pair of ſtony Stairs down into the terraſs Walk in the Garden: This he judg'd was the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious and moſt commodious paſſage to <hi>Roſelina</hi>'s Lodgings; and with this intention he came out of his Chamber; when paſſing through the ſame Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, he perceiv'd <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> with his hands croſs'd over his breaſt, with large and haſty ſteps meaſuring the length of it. Is it you, <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ovid,</hi> who walk at ſo large a rate? I had thought that your ſolitude, and this manner of walking, had not agreed with the indifferency you profeſs. Ha! my dear <hi>Ovid,</hi> reply'd <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> with a voice quite alter'd from its uſual tone, I am plung'd into the deepeſt Abyſs of Deſpair: you believe, doubtleſs, with all the World, that by a principle of indifferency, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd from the hand of <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Wife, he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd me. I believ'd indeed, reply'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having an averſion for the perſon of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> or againſt Marriage in general, you had preferr'd your liberty before all the Advantages, which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to you. This Maxim of Independency is commendable amongſt the ancient Stoicks, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us Modern <hi>Romans</hi> is a perfect Fanaticiſm. If you had had any pre-engagements, to which the offers of <hi>Caeſar</hi> were either repugnant, or deſtructive, the conſideration of your fidelity might perhaps fix a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94435:42"/> moderate cenſure upon your proceedings; but that without any other cauſe, but out of a meer capricio of fancy, you ſhould reject ſuch conſiderable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; attract the indignation of <hi>Caeſar</hi> by your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſals, abandon your Native Soil, to inhabit Rocks and Deſarts, is that, which with all your Friends, I muſt impute to you as a Problem of unanſwerable folly; and that, which I ſhould be glad, you were able to juſtifie to the World. I am able to juſtifie it moſt aſſuredly, reply'd <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> and with more facility to a perſon, who is not inſenſible of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Love, than to any other. Give Attention then to a Secret, which is more really a Secret, than that you have confided to me. I have a moſt ſincere kindneſs for you, and I find my grief too weighty, to neglect an occaſion to diſcharge a part of it, into the boſome of the beſt of my Friends.</p>

               <head>THE HISTORY OF Hortenſius.</head>
               <p>THE Mother of the great <hi>Julius,</hi> whoſe Neece <hi>Aurelia</hi> is, and whoſe Name ſhe bears, was deſcended, as without doubt you have heard, of the Race of the <hi>Hortenſiuses.</hi> This Alliance did allow me a familiarity with <hi>Aurelia</hi> from my infancy: And whereas this familiarity has been cenſur'd by ſome, to have been the Mother of that Antipathy, which the World judges is ingrafted in my nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the perſon of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> it has on the contrary prov'd the ground of a moſt immoveable and a moſt violent paſſion. I may preſume to publiſh it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the fear of a diſpleaſure. <hi>Aurelia</hi> expreſt a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reſpect, and confidence towards me; and I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd my ſelf, that her Relations would embrace my honorable Suit; but my Love was of no vulgar ſtamp, and character: It ambition'd to bind the heart of <hi>Aurelia</hi> to its faithful ſervices, and her own choice, rather than to the Laws of her Duty. My ready obedience did attend each nod of her head, each motion of her perſon; which I diſguis'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94435:43"/> the notion of a reſpect and diligence, our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance might challenge from me; but which were really ſervices, that claim'd a near Alliance to Love. I found they were underſtood in their right ſenſe by <hi>Aurelia;</hi> And believing, that the happy Moment to ſecond them was arriv'd, I went to ſeek her with that intention; when at my entrance into <hi>Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>'s Garden, where I heard ſhe was, I found ſome Tablets drop'd, which I knew belong'd to her: I open'd them with that impatient curioſity, which every one has for the concerns of the perſon, they love, where I found theſe Verſes:
<q>
                     <l>Draw to the life the Love-blind god; his face,</l>
                     <l>His hair, his feature, lineaments, and grace;</l>
                     <l>Add to theſe Charms a fierce and noble air,</l>
                     <l>Than you'll, th' ingrate, I love, find preſent there.</l>
                     <l>Imagine how juſt hopes do my deſires inflame;</l>
                     <l>Reſign my reaſon then to thoſe deſires, I name;</l>
                     <l>Oppoſe to both a Soul as fierce, as cold,</l>
                     <l>And you'll the myſt'ry of my ſighs unfold.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Verſes rais'd a tempeſt in my thoughts, though I knew no cauſe for it. <hi>Aurelia</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as great a liberty, as ſhe pleas'd; her Mother had been dead a long time, and ſhe was under the tuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Aunt, a perſon of a ſweet diſpoſition, who had an entire confidence in the virtue of her Niece. By this her manner of living, <hi>Aurelia</hi> attracted to her all the youthful Gallantry of the Court; but I could not perceive, that any of thoſe, who viſited her, did by any particular ſervices endeavor to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige her eſteem. She was neither of that rank, nor merit, to create an indifferency in the object of her deſires; in fine, I could ſee no cauſe to make an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94435:44"/> of thoſe Verſes to <hi>Aurelia:</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they charg'd my thoughts with an unuſual trouble and perplexity, I ſought her company, to diſſipate it; and having in vain made a diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt in every place, where I hop'd to find it, I was guided, at length, by my roving thoughts, into that part of the Cypreſs Grove, which borders upon the Labyrinth of Myrtles. I was ſcarce enter'd two or three paces into one of the Walks, when I thought I heard the voice of <hi>Aurelia</hi> from an Arbor not far diſtant from me; I gave a diligent attention: for there is no Lover, who would not be deſirous to rob his Miſtriſs of a ſecret, if he could do it ſo, as the Theft might not be diſcover'd.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, who attribute ſuch an unlimited power to Virtue, ſaid <hi>Aurelia</hi> to another perſon, are as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the effects of that, as of Love. Virtue is capable to give a bridle to our paſſions, but not ſtifle them in their birth; it has forc'd me to diſſemble thoſe ſentiments, I careſs for my Ingrate, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not effect, that this Ingrate ſhould not be the moſt amiable of all Men; that my eyes ſhould not think him ſo, and that maugre his indifferency, he ſhould not be the only perſon in the Univerſe, which I am deſtin'd to love. Oh! ye Gods, what ſhape of rage and jealouſie did not this diſcourſe transform me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? I thought my life would have expir'd betwixt them; but bridling the effects of both, that I might live to gain a perfect knowledge of all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of my Misfortune, I heard a perſon, whom, by the ſound of her voice, I conjectur'd to be <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidia, Mecoenas</hi>'s Niece, make this Anſwer: Is it poſſible that a perſon of ſo much reaſon and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould ſuffer herſelf to be charm'd by the eye? <hi>Cepion</hi> is a perſon, I muſt confeſs, of a good preſence
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94435:44"/> and meen, but the ſuperficial parts of a Man, ſhall never enſnare my heart; if I muſt ſurrender my liberty, it ſhould be to a noble paſſion, and to the languiſhing ſighs and vows of a no leſs noble Lover, and not to his good looks, or modiſh poſtures. Were he Maſter of all the beauties and charms, which Painters with their luxuriant Pencils have beſtow'd upon <hi>Adonis;</hi> if he were not paſſionate, humble, and faithful, I ſhould regard thoſe other exterior var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, no more than that of a beautiful Picture; and all, which that artificial Magick ſhould be able to charm from the ſenſe of my tendereſt affectation, would be at moſt but a favorable look, or ſmile. And what I have hitherto indulg'd to the charms of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi> reply'd <hi>Aurelia,</hi> has been no more: And ſo much they are able to command from all, that ſee him. I thought to have allow'd him no more, than what the moſt indifferent might grant him; but I perceiv'd, that the Idea's, which enter'd at the caſements of my eyes, did inſenſibly penetrate into the cabinet of my heart. I oftentimes imagin'd I ſaw the figure of <hi>Cepion</hi> a long time preſent before my eyes, after they had loſt the noble Object: He was all day the buſineſs of my thoughts, all night the labor of my fancy. I ſuffer'd theſe ſlight Preludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um's to gather ſtrength, by repoſing an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidence in thoſe Maxims, you juſt now deliver'd: for how could I ſuſpect, my heart ſhould be guilty of ſuch a folly, as to have a Paſſion for a Man, that had none for me? I believ'd with you, that a woman endu'd with common ſenſe, could never be capable of yielding up her Reaſon to the Attacks of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: But yet I did ſo; and though I perceiv'd by what Arts they betray'd me, yet I found it was not in my power to reſiſt the effects of their Treaſon.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94435:45"/> Oh! juſt Heavens! cry'd I out aloud, is it poſſible that this ſhould be <hi>Aurelia,</hi> who ſpeaks what I hear, and that <hi>Hortenſius</hi> ſhould be ſo unfortunate to hear, what ſhe ſpeaks? This Exclamation of mine, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to come ſuddenly forth of the Arbor, where they were. I leave you to judge, what a look <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia</hi> darted at me, when ſhe ſaw her ſecret was diſcover'd: Too curious, and ill-adviſed <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> ſaid ſhe, with an inflamed countenance, thou haſt, againſt my conſent, ſtolen from me the confeſſion of a weakneſs, which I would have conceal'd from the whole World: But, if thy looks do not deceive me, I ſhall find a means to chaſtiſe thy indiſcretion. I command thee never to ſet foot more within my Apartment, and I ſhall take ſuch caution to avoid thy Encounter in places indifferent, that thou ſhalt not often have the pleaſure to upbraid my bluſher with the imbecility of my Actions. Having ſaid this, ſhe flung away from me, and left me in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, I am not able to expreſs. I had ſcarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the firſt Fit of this Extaſie, when I ſaw <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi> approach me; we were very familiar, he came often to viſit <hi>Aurelia,</hi> and it was my cuſtom to ſpend ſix or ſeven hours every day in her company. What makes <hi>Hortenſius</hi> in this ſolitary place and poſture, ſaid he to me? Is he muſing upon his Amorous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures? Does he ſolace his thoughts with the pleaſure of ſome fortunate Encounter? Or put them into Mourning, for the loſs of his Miſtriſs? I believe <hi>Cepion</hi> had no other intention in his Railery, than to make it the Subject of a youthful diſcourſe; and that he knew not, how near it lanc'd me to the quick; but preſuming to fix ſuch an interpretation upon his words, as I borrow'd from the circumſtance of what had lately happen'd, it becomes you well,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94435:45"/> 
                  <hi>Cepion,</hi> ſaid I, to inſult thus over my Misfortunes; hug your ſelf with that fancy: But, perhaps, you may be defective in ſome Article of your conceited felicity, if thinking to rob me of the heart of <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> you ſhall not long enjoy the ſatisfaction of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in my diſgrace! I? cry'd <hi>Cepion,</hi> I rob you of the heart of <hi>Aurelia?</hi> No, ſaid I, in a rage, you do not rob me of it; for ſhe beſtows it as a free gift up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and this is a conqueſt too inglorious to boaſt of.</p>
               <p>The conqueſt, reply'd <hi>Cepion</hi> ſomething coldly, would be too glorious for <hi>Cepion;</hi> and I muſt avow, that <hi>Aurelia</hi> is capable to charm the whole World: but yet avouch too, that the heart of <hi>Cepion</hi> is unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to receive the impreſſion, which the Merit of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> has power to dilate through the Univerſe. The charms of that incomparable beauty, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a heart, pregnant with fidelity and conſtancy; deſires, which can acknowledge no other Deity, but herſelf, for their object, and many other perfections of an accompliſh'd Lover, which my Genius was never endu'd with: when I love, I love only for my ſelf; and the Paſſion, I entertain for Ladies, may be more properly call'd a youthful diverſion, than a real Love.</p>
               <p>I am not ſo credulous, ſaid I, interrupting him, to take for granted, what you affirm. You act a ſubtle part, under the diſguiſe of the indifferent one, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt I am aſſur'd, that <hi>Aurelia</hi> complains of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude; and that the exceſs of her love, or jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, preſents you to her eyes in the ſhape of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful one ſhe accuſes: But it is not poſſible you ſhould be ſo, towards a perſon of her Merit, and that you ſhould not love her, that loves you. You ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize me with Wonder, ſaid <hi>Cepion</hi> ſmiling, to ſee
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94435:46"/> you take ſo much pains to perſuade me I love <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> which you ought to take to diſſuade me from the thoughts of it, if I had ſo much preſumption, as to entertain any to that effect. This remark of his, began a little to recall me to my ſelf; I was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that I was guilty of an Act of high impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in endeavoring thus to convince my Rival of his good fortune. I ſuddenly pretended buſineſs with young <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> who croſs'd the end of the Walk, we were in; and being much diſſatisfi'd with my Miſtriſs, <hi>Cepion,</hi> and my ſelf, I haſtily reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red home to my houſe.</p>
               <p>Though I ever regarded with an eye of ſcorn and contempt the ſervile homage, the greateſt part of your Courtiers, pay to the Favorites of Princes, yet I would not do the glory of the great <hi>Agrippa</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, as to rank thoſe offices, the Court of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> render'd him, in the ſame form. I ſaw that his virtue purchas'd him his favor; and I endevor'd, by all the ſervices I was capable of, to convince him, that I had a moſt real and candid eſteem for his Merits; and I am aſſur'd, he held me in the number of his moſt particular Friends; he gave me a ſignal teſtimony of it, at that time, I mention: which you are not a ſtranger to, though perhaps, you may be, to the circumſtances. A deep Melancholy had ſeiz'd me, caus'd by the unproſperous ſucceſs of my amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſigns, and converted all the gaiety of my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor into a ſullen chagrin, when one day I was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertis'd, the Emperor commanded my preſence; I yielded a ready obedience to his commands. As ſoon as he ſaw me, he led me into his Cloſet; and after he had extoll'd the Nobility of my Extraction, and the Merit of many illuſtrious Heroes, it had preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Empire; I conſider, ſaid he, that Fortune
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94435:46"/> treats you, as ſhe uſes to treat perſons of higher Virtue; ſhe belies you to be ſo rich in your own, that the thinks ſhe ſhould offer you an affront, to make you a Preſent of any of her favors. I ſee many Families in <hi>Rome,</hi> which ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge an inferioſity to yours; whoſe Wealth or proſperous Suits, have elevated them to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Dignities. I will not ſuffer this injuſtice to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult longer over you. The Praetor, who held the Government of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is lately dead, which I confer upon you, with the Praetorſhip for the firſt year. I caſt my ſelf at the feet of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him thanks for a grace ſo unexpected, and leſs merited by me. Hold, ſaid <hi>Caeſar,</hi> this is not the ſole one, Intend you; Princes are accountable to none but the gods, for their Actions; though we ſee the beſt and the greateſt ſtand in need of the ſuffrages and affections of the meaneſt of their Subjects to ſupport their Soveraignty. There is not one of all my Followers, who can aſpire with more juſtice than your ſelf to the employ I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign you; but there are few amongſt them who will do my judgment that right as to aſſent to it; for every one is apt to think, that what is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon himſelf, is detracted from his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>But I will remove this ſtumbling Block out of their way, by colouring the Preſent, I ſhall make you, with the title of Alliance. <hi>Aurelia</hi> is Niece to the Mother of the Great <hi>Julius,</hi> my Father; and an obligation lies upon me, to make a proviſion for her eſtabliſhment; wherefore I beſtow her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you in Marriage; render your thanks for both theſe favors to <hi>Agrippa;</hi> for he is the perſon who
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94435:47"/> has reviv'd in my memory the character of the brave Race of the <hi>Hortenſiuses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider with your ſelf, I beſeech you, as well the trouble, as ſurprize, this Propoſal of <hi>Caeſar</hi> brought to my already diſtracted thoughts: If he had declared it but three or four days before, he had render'd me the moſt fortunate perſon of the Univerſe: I paſſionately lov'd <hi>Aurelia;</hi> and this paſſion was the firſt impreſſion that Love ever ſtampt upon my heart. I was ready to make my acknowledgements to the Emperor, and offer up at his feet all the thanks ſo unexampled a Grace could challenge from me: but a ſecond conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration repreſented to my confuſed thoughts the violence I ſhould impoſe upon <hi>Aurelia,</hi> if being wholly pre-ingaged in the favor of my Rival, I ſhould be an envious Inſtrument in compelling her to receive me for her Husband. This imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rais'd a civil war in my breaſt; I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to owe a Concern of ſo pretious a value, to any other Orders, than thoſe of Love. I told the Emperor, that I could not tell with what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment <hi>Aurelia</hi> wou'd receive the honor, his bounty was pleas'd to confer upon me; that I was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of its juſt eſtimate; and that I ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal both of my ſervices, and my bloud, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my ſelf worthy of it; but withal, that if with the Government of <hi>Egypt</hi> he ſhould offer me the moity of his Empire, I ſhould refuſe it, rather than hazard to force the inclinations of a Lady allied to the Bloud of <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperor commended as well my diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as modeſty; and telling me he would take upon himſelf the charge of obtaining <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's</hi> conſent to what he deſired, he left me, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94435:47"/> went towards the Empreſſes Apartment. As I was coming out of <hi>Caeſar's</hi> Cloſet, I met <hi>Cepion</hi> at the door; and well, ſaid he to me, drawing me aſide to a window, Are you yet of the opinion, that I am your Rival? Know it is I, who this day ſurrenders the poſſeſſion of <hi>Aurelia</hi> into your hands. I waited laſt night upon <hi>Agrippa</hi> in his Chamber, when he declar'd to divers perſons there preſent, the glorious fortune the Emperor had deſign'd you: I privately inform'd him of the condition, <hi>Caeſar</hi> was oblig'd to add to the reſt of his favors, if he intended to compleat your felicity: And is this a ſervice conſiſtent with the deſigns of a Man, that had an intention to rob you of the heart of your Miſtreſs? All that you have done, anſwered I, and all that <hi>Caeſar</hi> is able to do, cannot aſſure me, but that you are yet my Rival: That aſſurance is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lodged in the heart of <hi>Aurelia;</hi> and it is from thence, that I muſt draw it; But ſince I ſhall not be capable to obtain her, without committing a Rape upon her inclination, ſhe ſhall remain the Miſtreſs of <hi>Cepion</hi> for ever, and <hi>Hortenſius</hi> ſhall never be her Husband: you expreſs a great weakneſs, replyed <hi>Cepion,</hi> in harbouring thus an imagination, that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia</hi> has that kindneſs for me, which I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet perceive the leaſt ſymptom of; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I do not deſire a clearer evidence: for were it true, that ſhe ſhould honor me with ſome good wiſhes, a neceſſity would enforce me to requite them with an ingrateful inſenſibility: but though I glory in the expreſſion, I do not deſire to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe amongſt Women, the Title of <hi>Cruel,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate.</hi> Repeal this fanatical opinion, I conjure you, and believe, that there is no perſon in the Court of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who ſhall make you a more
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94435:48"/> ſincere Congratulation upon your glorious Marriage, than that you ſhall receive from <hi>Cepion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A great Concourſe of my friends, who came pay their Congratulations to me, upon the report of thoſe honors, <hi>Caeſar</hi> had heapt upon me, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted our longer Converſe. He aſſur'd himſelf of the obedience of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> and diſcourſed pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly of our Marriage before the Empreſs, and the Charge he had annext to it, as of a thing firmly ratified and concluded. I leave you to judge what a diſtraction I was in, when I was forced on all ſides to receive the Compliments of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi> I was ſenſible of an obſtacle that intercepted the way to my felicity, which none of them had a jealouſie of; which cauſed me to receive them with that coldneſs, which drew admiration from all that knew me whilſt every one by way of a ſerious kind of raillery, told me, I was not as ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as I ought to be, of the Bleſſings Heaven had ſhowred upon me. I was expos'd to this perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution all the reſt of the day; and as I walkt forth in the evening, to diſengage my ſelf from ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubleſome Viſitants, I met one of <hi>Aurelia's</hi> Slaves, who came from her Lady to tell me, that ſhe had ſome buſineſs with me, and deſir'd my company. I had never ſeen her ſince the day ſhe had forbidden me her houſe. I ran to preſent my ſelf unto her with that confuſion and haſte, as your fancy will eaſily comprehend. You have done this morning, ſaid ſhe to me, as I approacht her, an act of the higheſt generoſity, that ever man could yet boaſt of: I am acquainted with all the circumſtances of ſo glorious an action; It is not ſufficient to ſay a man loves, to convince the World that he does ſo; Effects are more expreſſive
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94435:48"/> than Words, and I do not doubt but that you have a real paſſion for me; yet notwithſtanding you have rejected the offers of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> taken into your compaſſionate conſideration my pre-ingagements; and renouncing the title another would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you over my Heart, ſacrific'd your moſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate deſires to a generous deſpair, for fear of impoſing a violence upon my inclinations: Ha! <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> what ought not my gratitude to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, to compenſate thy generoſity? I could quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with my Stars for your ſake, in being ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to give me ſuch fatal inclinations. Lend me your aſſiſtance to conquer them; redeem my heart out of the power of that Ingrate, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it priſoner againſt my conſent; you have a ſpacious field granted you, to draw up all your forces in, to attack his unworthineſs; compel my Soul to do that through gratitude, which through the influence of my unfortunate Stars it is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do by inclination.</p>
               <p>After divers expreſſions to this effect, which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd by ſubmiſſive regards, and deep ſighs more ſenſibly than by words; we agreed, that to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge me time to induce her to that, which her goodneſs was then pleaſed to ſtile her duty, I ſhould make it my requeſt to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> to ſupplicate <hi>Caeſar</hi> to allow me a ſhort ſpace to conſider the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, he had made me. <hi>Agrippa</hi> was ſurpriz'd when he heard me; You do not ſeriouſly reflect upon what you ſay, reply'd <hi>Agrippa:</hi> the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Egypt</hi> is the moſt conſiderable that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> has in his power to diſpoſe of; it is ambition'd by the moſt illuſtrious Pretenders about the Court; and although the apprehenſions of ſeeing it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd into other hands ſhould not oblige you to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94435:49"/> preſs the Emperor to the execution of his promiſe, yet the poſſeſſion of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> ſhould methinks, excite you to proſecute all advantages, with a moſt reſtleſs impatience. The poſſeſſion of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> my Lord, ſaid I, would not be the ſame to me, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it might be to another. I muſt be excuſed if I declare no more to you at preſent; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining, whether I have reaſon on my ſide or no, I humbly beg in the name of that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip you are pleaſed to honor me with, that you would endeavor to retard for a while the effects of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s generoſity towards me. <hi>Agrippa</hi> might with eaſe, ſatisfie my requeſt; for news came that ſame day, that the Praetor, who commanded in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was not dead; that he was paſt hopes of recovery, and that his diſtemper was accompanied with ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, which were judged to be mortal, but that he was yet alive.</p>
               <p>I had now as much time, as <hi>Aurelia</hi> could hope for, to accompliſh the cure, ſhe deſir'd me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake. I left no ſtone unmov'd to effect a work of ſuch importance; and <hi>Cepion</hi> ſeem'd to ſecond me with his faithful endeavors. He utter'd things in the preſence of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> which touch me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with real reſentments againſt his ingratitude. I thank Heaven, ſaid he, one day, diſcourſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubject of the deaths of <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi> that I was not born to be commended to Poſterity for one of thoſe memorable examples: I am incapable of that honor; and what would be a glorious fortune another, would prove to me the greateſt of misfortune. The Ladies are ſo fully convinc'd of this truth in me, that they think it not worth their pains to level their Darts at ſo impenetrable a Mark, as my Heart; and I am much
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94435:49"/> oblig'd to them for their diſcretion; for if any one of them ſhould either out of inclination, or any other motive, teſtifie the leaſt good will for me, I ſhould fly her company, as one would fly the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of his greateſt Enemy.</p>
               <p>Theſe diſcourſes did oftentimes produce their effect: The Curtain is drawn from before my Eyes, ſaid <hi>Aurelia</hi> to me, <hi>Cepion</hi> is not ſo worthy of my affection, as his flattering appearances would falſly perſuade me. I muſt aver, for the credit of my own judgment, that there are few men in the World, in whom the exteriour Characters ſhine with a nobler luſtre than in his; but do you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the pride and audacity, which uſurps a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative over all his other qualifications. He has ſuch a reſpect for himſelf, as begets in him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and diſ-reſpect of all others. He looks as if he conceited no perſon but himſelf were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his own eſteem. This ſelf-love from his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, paſſes to his Spirit and Wit; he is enamour'd of his own opinions; and eſteems it a point of honor to enter the Liſts, and ſuſtain them againſt Opponents; our Sex is not thought worthy to have the liberty of offering an argument in its own defence; the leaſt condeſcenſion in favor of it, he accounts a blemiſh to his high erudition, and thinks he ſhould wound his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to admit a Woman to enterpriſe her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict in any of his diſputes. Ha! generous <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius,</hi> did I owe you no other acknowledgements than for the cure you have effected upon thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious errors, wherewith that arrogant perſon had infected my judgment, I ſhould die deeply in your debt. Madam, ſaid I, the beſt expedient to compleat the cure you mention, is to proſcribe that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94435:50"/> Ingrate both from your thoughts and lips; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you do not name him, but to accuſe his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages; yet this is always to entertain him in your thoughts; and what pretence ſoever it be, that revokes him to your memory, ought to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have a tincture of love in it. That tincture, thanks to the gods, ſaid <hi>Aurelia,</hi> my Soul is now free from, and I bluſh to think it ſhould ever have received ſo ignoble an impreſſion. I was enchanted without doubt, and the Paſſion I had for a man who requited it with ſo little reſpect, or complaiſance, could not be but the effect of a magical operation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aurelia</hi> was not long fixt to this opinion; one obliging expreſſion, one civil regard of <hi>Cepion,</hi> would re-entangle her again as faſt as ever in the ſnares of her old Amour. Sometimes ſhe would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the noble part of his perſon: ſometimes the color and elegancy of his hair; when any one diſcourſes before her of any features or charms, which were remarkable in the face of another, and had a reſemblace of thoſe in <hi>Cepion</hi>'s; thoſe graces, would ſhe ſay to me, with a ſigh, can pretend in no other perſon in the World to thoſe advantages, they find in my Ingrate. Did you ever ſee a blew eye ſparkle like his? Nature has mixt in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion all her richeſt colors. The whiteneſs of his teeth, makes Ivory it ſelf look pale for envy; his mouth, though large, includes in its circumference a thouſand charms; and his meen breaths I know not what; ſo gentile and noble, that it commands both reſpect and admiration, from all that behold him.</p>
               <p>This levity and conſtancy of humor, did more than half diſtract me; I reſolv'd a thouſand times
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94435:50"/> to make a private retreat out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and fly ſo far from the noiſe of misfortunes, that I ſhould never hear more the names of <hi>Cepion</hi> and <hi>Aurelia.</hi> But at length my perſeverance ſeem'd to attract upon my ſufferings ſome compaſſion from Heaven; <hi>Aurelia</hi> ſolemnly proteſted to me, that ſhe perceiv'd the hour was near at hand, wherein her diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſhould receive a perfect cure; and all her actions avoucht her expreſſions. She could ſee <hi>Cepion</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing color; ſhe teſtifyed no regard of any thing, he affected to ſay to her. She ſcarce took notice he was in any place, where ſhe was. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this alteration in <hi>Aurelia</hi> produc'd the ſame effect in the Soul of my Rival, as the like might do in the thoughts of moſt men; I obſerv'd that he followed <hi>Aurelia</hi> with more aſſiduity and ardor than before; he was always whiſpering ſome little ſecret in her ear, and I oftentimes diſcover'd them making to each other private ſigns of intelligence. This new intrigue involv'd me in a new perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and I could not conceal it from <hi>Aurelia.</hi> You do my ſincerity an injury, ſaid ſhe to me; I have ingenuouſly confeſs'd to you all the errors of my weakneſs; which you ought to believe I have long ſince repeal'd, ſince you have my ſolemn prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation for it; Indulge a peace to your troubled thoughts; <hi>Cepion</hi> ſhall never be the object of my love, his triumphs have ſeen their moſt glorious days. Why then, Madam, ſaid I, are there ſo many viſible marks daily given of a ſecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, to alarm my jealouſie? That which alarms your ſuſpition, reply'd <hi>Aurelia,</hi> ought to aſſure you of my integrity; the hatred of that, which once one tenderly affected, is a kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which wears the Vizard Mask of a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94435:51"/> I will not ſuffer one ſpark of that fire to harbor it ſelf any longer in my heart; and <hi>Cepion</hi> is now grown indifferent to me, to that degree, that I ſhall always place him in the firſt rank of my Friends, and the laſt of my Lovers.</p>
               <p>This kind of indifferency did not at all reliſh to the palate of my Love; I conjur'd <hi>Aurelia</hi> to confine her diſingagements within the beaten tract of others; and not expoſe her ſelf to thoſe dangerous precipices, to the brink whereof her nice diſtinctions muſt neceſſarily reduce her. She ſpoke many paſſionate things to me, which in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ought to have convinc'd my jealouſie; but they could not calm it: I obſerv'd daily the familiar carriage of her, and my Rival; but too much for my repoſe. As I was coming one night out of <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> his houſe, when I had Supt, (which is ſeated, as you know, in a place of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Concourſe) and croſſing a paſſage, which leads from the Garden down to the River <hi>Tyber,</hi> I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd by the Moon-ſhine, the glimps of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which ſeem'd to me to wear the Liverty of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia.</hi> I ſtopt to ſee how he would diſpoſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; when preſently I ſaw him go directy to a Man, who about thirty paces from thence, ſtood waiting among ſome Trees; they went both of them together from that place, and directed their courſe towards a private door, which open'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Mecoenas</hi> his Gardens, and there went in. I had a curioſity to be inform'd of their defign, which cauſed me to follow them. I had ſcarce got into one of the Allies, which firſt offer'd it ſelf to my ſilent ſteps, when I thought I heard <hi>Cepion</hi>'s Voice from the other ſide of a Quickſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedge, next to me.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:94435:51"/>
               <p>Did'ſt thou take good notice of the place where thou did'ſt leave her? ſaid he, Yes, my Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd another man; ſhe waits for you in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, at the end of the great Terraſs, which is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with thoſe yellow Flowers which came out of <hi>Spain.</hi> My dear Boy, ſaid <hi>Cepion,</hi> what rewards do I not owe thy zeal and fidelity? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thy freedom, which I am aſſur'd I can beg of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> I have nothing in the World that I think a recompence equal to this ſervice, thou haſt done me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cepion</hi> kept walking on, as he talkt, and I kept at an even diſtance with him; but ſtopt a little before I came to the end of the Walk, for fear of meeting him; I ſaw him croſs over a green ſquare, and perceived diſtinctly from the place where I ſtood, that it was the ſame perſon, I had ſeen before amongſt the trees, and that the Slave that followed him, belong'd to <hi>Aurelia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am able to convince the World, that never man yet died of grief or jealouſie, ſince I ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd that fatal ſight. Shaking and trembling I crept along under the ſhelter of a Pomegranate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedge, that border'd one ſide of the Terraſs, which my Rival aſcended; and ſtealing ſoftly round the Arbor the Slave had deſcrib'd, I apply'd my ear to that part of it, which was thickeſt ſhaded, with the over-hanging leaves and curling flowers. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with me, my dear <hi>Ovid,</hi> from relating to you what I then heard, I am diſtracted with rage and jealouſie, as often as I think upon this abhorr'd encounter. I was reſolv'd to interrupt the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of this too happy Rival, and had in my fury waſht away the ſtains of the affront, he offer'd my love, with his Blood; but my Sword being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94435:52"/> in ſome of the boughs, forced me to make ſome noiſe to diſengage it; which ſtruck a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den terror into the fortunate Lovers. The Lady committed her haſty flight to the dark ſhades; and <hi>Cepion</hi> leaping off from the Terraſs into the Walk under it, conveyed himſelf away with ſuch ſpeed, that it was impoſſible for me to retrieve him amongſt thoſe intricate Meanders. My greedy eye made a ſtrict ſearch after my unfaithful one, to charge her treachery with my juſt reproaches; but all I could recover of her was a glimps at a great diſtance, as ſhe ran into the houſe, with her Slave at her heels. I went to the door to wait for her coming forth, with a reſolution to impeach her of her Treaſon; but ſhe returned not that night to her own Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and I was inform'd by her Coachman, who drove home her Chariot, that ſhe intended to lodge with <hi>Heluidia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You are a Maſter in the Art of Love, my dear <hi>Ovid,</hi> and do doubtleſs comprehend, what the moſt ſignificant expreſſions, would be too dull a Pencil to depaint to you. I paſt the whole night in meaſuring the length of my Chamber over and over with my large paces; and next morning <hi>Agrippa</hi> did me the honor to give me a viſit. I know not what more, ſaid he, approaching me, to alledge to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for the farther retardment of his Commands. Our Praetor is now infallibly dead; and laſt night <hi>Aurelia</hi> advertis'd the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror by <hi>Terentia,</hi> that his deſigns and commands in your favor, were entirely conformable to her own deſires. Do you tell me, my Lord, ſaid I, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting his diſcourſe, that <hi>Aurelia</hi> has aſſur'd the Emperor, ſhe gives her free conſent to our Marriage? Yes certainly, ſaid <hi>Agrippa;</hi> and does
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94435:52"/> likewiſe preſs the accompliſhment of it with all the earneſtneſs, her modeſty can diſpence with. I am much oblig'd to her, anſwered I, for ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous a complaiſance; but ſhe may honor ſome other with it, if ſhe pleaſes; for <hi>Aurelia</hi> ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the Wife of <hi>Hortenſius.</hi> You are not, I fear, in your right underſtanding, reply'd <hi>Agrippa,</hi> aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht at my repartee, What can you deſire in a a Woman, which you cannot find in <hi>Aurelia?</hi> She is full of Youth, Beauty, Wit, and allied to <hi>Coeſar,</hi> who preſents her to you with his own hand, and for a Portion, the moſt eminent Charge in the whole Empire. The Emperor may Portion her with the whole Empire it ſelf, if he pleaſes, ſaid I, but <hi>Hortenſius</hi> ſhall never ſhare any part in his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Heavens! What can I alledge in your juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reply'd <hi>Agrippa,</hi> when the Emperor ſhall juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſent this unexampled contempt of his moſt gracious favors? I will tell him, ſaid I, that I am reſolv'd never to marry; that I have a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral antipathy againſt the Sex; and that nothing ought to be more free to a Man than the reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his liberty. You ought to have declared ſo much before, ſaid <hi>Agrippa,</hi> diſpleas'd with my diſcourſe, and not to expoſe a Coſin-German of the Great <hi>Julius</hi> to the publick ſcandal of an open repulſe. This manner of proceeding is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any excuſe; your friends will all diſown your intereſts, if you do not ſpeedily return to your ſelf; and do that with a ready complaiſance, which you cannot refuſe to do, without drawing upon your ſelf, together with an inevitable ruin, the indignation of an incenſed Emperor. I was furniſh'd, but with too many and too convincing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94435:53"/> reaſons, which I might have offered in my own defence, but a too juſt reſpect for that ingrateful one; for whom I ever had, and ſtill retain an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Paſſion, hindred me from publiſhing her infamy. She thought perhaps to put this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to the extremity of the Teſt; or whether it were that ſhe imagin'd it was not in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to withdraw it, from the object, it had been ſo long ſetled upon, or that being really ignorant of the true cauſe of my reſentments, ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to clap a ſpecious Mask over the viſage of her foul fac'd Intrigue, ſhe counterfeited a moſt extreme grief, for the repulſe, I had given her ſolemn declarations. She ſent me Letters, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute that Capricio of mine, as ſhe term'd it, ſugar'd over with expreſſions, as would certainly have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd me, had it been poſſible for artifice to have done it. I was tranſported beyond all patience at this laſt teſtimony of her treachery; and I think I ſhould ſcarce have commanded the impetuoſity of my rage, had I had an opportunity to have vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; but <hi>Caeſar,</hi> diſcovering nothing in my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, but what bore the character of Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and Ingratitude, ſent a party of his Guards to me, with a Commiſſion to Convoy me out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and an expreſs command likewiſe to forbid me to return, till he was pleas'd to recal me.</p>
               <p>You are now acquainted with the ſecret of that Adventure, which with ſo much injuſtice, has fixt upon me the title of <hi>Indifferent.</hi> But, my dear <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> ſee the capriciouſneſs of my deſtiny: the Image of <hi>Aurelia</hi> is ſcarce yet defac'd out of my Soul; rage and contempt ought to have baniſht it out of all her dominion, the very inſtant I diſcover'd her Treaſons; but a heart condemned by heaven to a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94435:53"/> rigorous fate of conſtancy, is deaf to all admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and inſenſible of all advantages, which are offered for its diſingagement. I muſt avouch, to the ſhame of my judgment, that I am not yet poſſeſt with a due reſentment of <hi>Aureliaes</hi> ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; I conſerve neither a Love, nor an eſteem for her; but that deſpight, which now uſurps the place of both, is a greater Tyrant to my repoſe, than thoſe ever were: And could you imagine what object malitious fortune ſhould now preſent to this deſpight? <hi>Cepion,</hi> that very <hi>Cepion,</hi> who is the Author of all my misfortunes, and from whom I have deriv'd ſo many fatal injuries, is at this hour in the Iſle of <hi>Thalaſſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You tell me a wonder, ſaid <hi>Ovid,</hi> What deſign has invited him to viſit this inhumane Climate? I know not, reply'd <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> but he landed ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday in the evening; and lodged laſt night at <hi>Lentulus</hi> his quarters; I fancy'd I ſaw <hi>Cepion</hi> afar off walking with him, as I return'd from waiting upon Ladies to their Lodgings; but the little probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch a truth leſſening the credit of my eyes at ſuch a diſtance, I could allow none to ſo ſtrange a Viſion. Whereupon I ſent one of my Servants to be inform'd of the reality of it, who affirms that which my eyes did make a doubt of; <hi>Cepion</hi> is in this Iſland, and I muſt either be forc'd to endure the ſight of a perſon I hate above all the World, or deſert a Solitude, which I begin to take delight in, and have expended too much coſt and time in cultivating it, to leave it without a ſenſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was ſpeaking this, he eſpy'd <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus</hi> at the other end of the Galery, and with him his Rival, whoſe ſight he ſo much abhorred. <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:94435:54"/> could not Maſter the firſt motions of his horror; he ow'd a reſpect to the place, which ſomething reflected upon the perſon, who was in his own houſe; and never did man more religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly maintain the Laws of hoſpitality, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs of civility; but at this time, being incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of obſerving either, he haſtily ruſh'd into <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Chamber, and ſhut the door after him. <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus</hi> had a particular kindneſs for <hi>Cepion,</hi> from whom he had received an important advice, which nearly concern'd his ſafety; &amp; this ſole motive had brought him into <hi>Thalaſſia. Lentulus</hi> was toucht to the Soul, to ſee in what manner he was treated by <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> What frenzie has invaded your friend? ſaid he to <hi>Ovid:</hi> Is he ſubject to theſe diſtempers? Or is it our fight, that has brought them upon him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cepion</hi> is able to reſolve your doubt, reply'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> ſmiling upon <hi>Lentulus:</hi> he of the three is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom this proceeding, I preſume, does leaſt ſurpriſe. I ſwear to you, ſaid <hi>Cepion,</hi> I am no leſs ſurpriz'd at it, than either of you can be. <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> has been formerly of an opinion, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſon expreſt too great a kindneſs for me in a circumſtance he was not capable to digeſt: I thought I had not omitted any thing to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him of his error: But he has ſince teſtified ſo ſcornful a contempt for the Lady, who was the ſubject of that conteſt, that though he thought himſelf not oblig'd to credit my proceedings, yet his own mutability in deſerting his Miſtreſs, ought to have diſſipated thoſe clouds of jealouſie, which hung ſo long over his head. You relate to us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but falſe appearances, ſaid <hi>Ovid;</hi> he that would ſatisfie his credulity with them, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94435:54"/> 
                  <hi>Hortenſius</hi> were in a fault; you could not prevent any perſons having a kindneſs for you; you did not endeavor to improve that kindneſs; nay you contributed all that lay in your power to extinguiſh it. But <hi>Cepion,</hi> but the Moon-light Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture in the Garden of <hi>Mecoenas;</hi> the Aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Arbor at the end of the Great Terraſs, pray tell us, does it deſerve in your opinion the thanks, or embraces of <hi>Hortenſius? Cepion</hi> ſtood mute for a while at this reproach of <hi>Ovid;</hi> then ſuddenly lifting up his hands and eyes to Heaven; Oh! ye juſt gods, cry'd he out, What is this, I hear? How? ſaid he, fixing his eyes intentively upon <hi>Ovid;</hi> Is <hi>Hortenſius</hi> acquainted with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of the Grand Terraſs? So well, reply'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> that he was even an ear-witneſs to it. It was he who made that noiſe, and gave you the Alarm, that forc'd you to leap over the Terraſs; and it was that aſſurance of your felicity, which caus'd him to judge it would not be any diſcretion in him, to diſturb it, by marrying the perſon, who was propoſed to him.</p>
               <p>With that <hi>Cepion</hi> walkt towards the door, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he had ſeen <hi>Hortenſius</hi> enter. Grant me the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, I beſeech you, ſaid he, to confute the moſt unjuſt opinion that ever ſuſpition yet harbor'd in her jealous Brain. <hi>Aurelia</hi>'s virtue is unblemiſht with the crimes with which you charge it; ſhe affects you moſt paſſionately; and ſupports all your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches with a goodneſs, that merits your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt adorations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ovid</hi> wiſely imagin'd that <hi>Hortenſius</hi> would be deſirous to convince <hi>Cepion</hi> of an error, or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd by him of his own; and judging that <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus</hi> would be a ſufficient Umpire in the caſe, he

He was ſcarce out of the houſe when a young Slave, who waited on <hi>Roſelina,</hi> came from his Miſtreſs to enquire for him. <hi>Lentulus</hi> ſpy'd the Boy, at the entrance of a door, which <hi>Hortenſius</hi> his Servants had open'd. to look into the Room for <hi>Ovid.</hi> He run to him, to ask him his buſineſs. I have brought a Note from <hi>Roſelina,</hi> ſaid the Slave, to a <hi>Roman,</hi> who lodges here. Give it me, ſaid <hi>Lentulus,</hi> and I will deliver it to <hi>Ovid.</hi> The Boy knowing that <hi>Lentulus</hi> was a particular friend of his Miſtreſs, made no difficulty to give him the Ticket he brought. <hi>Lentulus</hi> walkt a little aſide, that the Slave might not ſee him open it, and with an earneſt curioſity caſting his eyes upon it, he found theſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<q>Your <hi>Thalaſſian</hi> Miſtreſs is reſolved to grant you the private interview, you beg'd of her. Fail not to render your ſelf this night at the ſame Wilderneſs where you writ the Verſes, you know of; all things ſhall be ſo diſpoſed, that you ſhall enjoy your deſired ſatisfaction without diſturbance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herennia</hi> did not declare her ſelf in the Billet to be the Lover, it ſpoke of; but jealouſie would not ſuffer <hi>Lentulus</hi> to doubt it could be any other. He ſaw her, as ſhe came out of the Wilderneſs, which the Ticket made mention of; and found her reading ſomething, which he judg'd to be the Verſes, it ſpecifi'd; and ſhe her ſelf had told him, that what ſhe was reading, did treat of a Love-intrigue.</p>
               <p>He is now fully convinc'd, that <hi>Herennia</hi> is not only unfaithful, but that <hi>Ovid</hi> too is the ſecret Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94435:55"/> he ſeeks after. Whereupon he reſolves to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf at the appointed Rendezvous, inſtead of the new Lover; and after he had returned an anſwer to the Slave, by one of <hi>Hortenſius</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, That <hi>Ovid</hi> would not fail to obey the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which were ſent him, he went forth in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious rage, and left <hi>Cepion</hi> and <hi>Aureliaes</hi> Lover the liberty to entertain each other without Witneſſes, or conſtraint. The amorous <hi>Ovid</hi> had nothing leſs in his thoughts, than what was projecting againſt him. He was ignorant of the Rape, <hi>Tiſienus</hi> had committed upon the Letter of <hi>Sulpicia;</hi> he knew not what a Monſter was hatching in the jealous breaſt of <hi>Lentulus,</hi> and thinking upon nothing but the charms of <hi>Roſelina,</hi> and the pleaſant Intrigue he was like to be embarkt in, he ſacrific'd to this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity all his deſigns and adorations. He found not his fair Goddeſs at her own Temple, and was told by her Servants, that ſhe was gone forth to take the Air in the Wood, which border'd upon: the ſhoar. He run thither with all the ſpeed, the Wings of his deſires could carry him, that he might not looſe the opportunity of <hi>Lentulus</hi> his abſence. He ſearcht all the beaten tracts, nor left he thoſe unviſited, which were leaſt frequented, but could not retrieve the fair Game: He hunted back again upon the foil; and deſpairing at laſt to gain a view of it, he was ready to return to <hi>Roſelinaes</hi> Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to ſee whether ſhe were to come back thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or no; when ſeveral loud cries gave his aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd ears the alarm from the neighboring ſhoar. He run with a precipitate haſte to the place, from whence he thought thoſe cries were ſent; where he ſaw a young Lady of exquiſite Beauty, ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by violence to diſengage her ſelf from a man
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94435:56"/> in whoſe Arms ſhe was detained an unwilling pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; who, having perforce gain'd her liberty, came running to <hi>Ovid</hi> for ſuccor: he interpos'd himſelf immediately betwixt the Lady, and the man that purſu'd her, and catching him by the Arm; What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are, ſaid he to him, who offer this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly violence to this young Lady; you have made choice of an ill place to execute your foul deſigns in. This Iſland is inhabited by many noble He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, who have an entire veneration for this fair Sex; and will all ſacrifice their lives at their feet, before any one of them ſhould ſuffer the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</p>
               <p>The unknown employ'd no other language than a profound ſigh, to return an anſwer to <hi>Ovid</hi>'s diſcourſe, and ſinking down upon the Sands, gave cauſe to the <hi>Roman</hi> to judge, both by the paleneſs of his countenance, and the tracts of blood, which in divers places diſtain'd his cloaths, that he had received ſome dangerous wound. Whereupon <hi>Ovid</hi> chang'd his deſign from the oppoſing, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving a perſon in ſo ill a condition. He ran to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea for ſome Water to refreſh him; when a little farther he diſcover'd two men more, engag'd in a mortal Combat, whereof one, before he could come to them, fell dead at the feet of the other. He that remain'd victorious, appear'd ſo charming to the eyes of <hi>Ovid,</hi> that he conſider'd him as ſomething more than Mortal. He retired a pace or two backwards, and ſurveying him with admiration, he was going to expreſs the wonder of his thoughts in the beſt of his language; but the fierce unknown would not allow him the time; and not ſo much as vouchſafing him a look, rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lanc'd himſelf forth in the purſuit of the fair
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94435:56"/> Fugitive. <hi>Ovid</hi> thought himſelf not oblig'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt his pious intent, to follow a Man of ſo little civility; wherefore he continued on his courſe towards the Sea; where he found a Shallop anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſhoar, and in her a Man, who ſeem'd to be her Pilot. <hi>Ovid</hi> askt him, if he could not furniſh him out of ſome of his Casks with a little freſh Water, to relieve a perſon, who lay gaſping for breath, at the entrance of the next Wood. The Mariner gave him to underſtand by ſigns, that he was both deaf and dumb; but by a quick gheſs comprehended his demands, drew a little Bottle out of his Pocket, fill'd it with water, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him to the place, <hi>Ovid</hi> had endeavor'd by ſigns likewiſe to deſcribe to him. They both employ'd their utmoſt skill to recall the Soul back again of the breathleſs Youth; which was fled from its ancient Harbor; but what <hi>Ovid</hi> at firſt thought only to be a ſwooning Fit, prov'd in the end, a real Death.</p>
               <p>The Mute made a horrid kind of bellowing and confuſed noiſe at the ſight of ſo diſmal an object. <hi>Ovid</hi> pointed to the place likewiſe, where the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead Man lay, and leaving him to exerciſe his charity about their Corps, was reſolv'd to gain ſome clearer evidence of ſo ſtrange an Encounter: and purſuing the tract, he had ſeen the unknown Lady take, he diſcover'd her in the great Road, which paſt thorough the mid'ſt of the Wood; and the ſtrange Youth, whoſe excellent Meen had ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him ſo much before, upon his knees at her feet; who by the ſigns, he ſaw him expreſs at a diſtance, ſeem'd to be an earneſt Suiter to her for her ſtay: But ſhe ſeem'd neither to be mov'd with his Charms, nor his Intreaties, and angrily fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94435:57"/> out of his Arms, kept on her way upon the Road ſhe was in. <hi>Ovid</hi> by a croſs cut gain'd the advantage of her ſpeed, and overtook her, juſt as her wearineſs forc'd her to fit down upon the ground, to eaſe her delicate limbs. Forbear, ſweet Stranger, ſaid he to her, to afflict your ſelf in this manner; you are here in a Sanctuary of ſafety; and you ſhall find in this Iſland four or five <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who will as freely lay down their lives, if an honorable occaſion ſhall call upon them, in your defence, as in their own; I am very much oblig'd to your generoſity, reply'd the Lady, in a kind of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Latin; I have no more Enemies, whoſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence I fear; and though the perſecution I now ſuſtain, invirons my Soul with greater horror, than that the Heavens have ſo lately deliver'd me from, yet I do not think that it will compel me to have recourſe to the famous Arms of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> No, Divine <hi>Agaritha,</hi> (ſaid the beautiful Youth following the Lady at a diſtance, who fled from him) you need employ no other Arms, than your inflamed eyes, to deſtroy the unfortunate <hi>Heren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. Ovid</hi> fixed his eyes intentively upon him, when he heard him pronounce the name of <hi>Heren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius;</hi> are you, ſaid he, the Son of <hi>Herennius,</hi> who followed <hi>Sertorius</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> at the time of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s tyranny? Yes, Sir, reply'd the Youth, I am the ſame, you mention. Do you know <hi>Lentulus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ovid,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces in the laſt Expedition againſt the <hi>Getes?</hi> I have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to know the perſon, you name, anſwered <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennius,</hi> ſince he may challenge not the leaſt ſhare in the firſt misfortunes of my life. You are arriv'd in a place, where you have more friends perhaps, than you imagine, reply'd <hi>Ovid;</hi> give me leave to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94435:57"/> be your Guide to a Houſe not far diſtant from hence, where I ſhall preſent you with a view of ſome perſons, whoſe ſight, I ſuppoſe, may requite the pains you ſhall take in going to them. He reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the fair Stranger, to give them the favor of her company too; which ſhe granted, <hi>Ovid</hi> lent her his hand to raiſe her from her humble Seat, and to conduct her likewiſe towards the houſe of <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius:</hi> The brave <hi>Herennius</hi> offered to take her by the other hand; but ſhe rudely thruſting him aſide, How dar'ſt thou approach me Traitor? ſaid ſhe; aſpire no more to the honor of touching that hand, which I have given thee but too often for my repoſe, and thy glory. Is it poſſible, <hi>Agaritha,</hi> reply'd <hi>Herennius,</hi> that ſo many humble Petitions for a Pardon offer'd up, ſo many Tears ſhed at your feet, ſo many times my Life hazarded in your ſervice, and this day eſpecially againſt your moſt mortal Enemies, ſhould not have the power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face out of your thoughts, the memory of a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo often expiated by an unfeined repentance? Is it a Crime unpardonable in a perſon of my age, to give ear or credit to the flattering diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the firſt Princeſs of the Univerſe; which to have entertained with ſcorn, would certainly have been judg'd an unpardonable rudeneſs in me? I believ'd (though too ſoon) you were dead: and my ſubmiſſion to the Charms of a Princeſs, who ſubjugates to her Laws all Hearts, that dare approach her, cannot properly be term'd an inconſtancy, but, in the worſt ſence; a too haſty oblivion only of your Death. Go perfidious wretch, ſaid the enraged fair One, interrupting him, excuſe not thy levity in the opinion of my death; the ſolemn proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thy Love, and the memory of thy infinite mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94435:58"/> fortunes that treacherous Love has involv'd me in, ought to have induc'd thee to examine ſtrictly each particular of a report, which ought ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have concern'd thee. But thou wert pleaſed doubt of my life, becauſe it oppoſed an obſtacle to thy new Amours: thou did'ſt fear my reproaches would have alarm'd thee, from which my death would have ſecur'd thee; and thou did'ſt flatter thy ſelf with the pleaſing thoughts of that, which thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy perſuaded thee to hope for. The name of the firſt Princeſs of the Univerſe, had raiſed a Conteſt betwixt a paleneſs and a bluſh in <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Face; he thought no perſon had any right to that Title, but the Daughter of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> He was about to ask <hi>Herennius,</hi> who that Princeſs was, he ſpoke of; but the fear of rendring his curioſity too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, caus'd him to defer it to a fitter oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. Whil'ſt <hi>Ovid</hi> was framing a thouſand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits to himſelf in his ſuſpitious fancy upon the Words of <hi>Herennius,</hi> and the young Lover by an ingenious confeſſion and ſubmiſſion excuſing his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to his incenſed and irreconcileable Miſtreſs; <hi>Hortenſius</hi> received from the Mouth of <hi>Cepion</hi> the Relation of a Miſtery, which after the turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent agitation of ſo long a ſtorm, brought a gentle calm to his thoughts.</p>

               <p>YOU made a right judgment, ſaid <hi>Cepion</hi> to <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> my inſenſibility was nothing but a dext'rous faint; but this faint had not for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the perſon, you aſcrib'd to it. I have lov'd <hi>Helvidia</hi> ſince the firſt hour, my Soul was capable of an impreſſion of love; and I got a particular friend of mine to ſound the intentions of <hi>Mecoenas</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſpoſal of his Neece, whoſe beauty began to eclipſe the luſtre of the reſplendent <hi>Terentia,</hi> who much deſir'd to ſee her cloyſter'd up in a Convent of Veſtals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Helvidia</hi> is not deſign'd for Marriage, (reply'd <hi>Mecoenas</hi> to my friend, who, without naming me, endevor'd to gain a clear intelligence of his reſolves) and whoſoever ſhall go about to inſpire her with contrary ſentiments, ſhall not at all oblige me. Your reſolution ſurprizes me, ſaid my friend, I ſee all other perſons, whom their Princes favor has plac'd in an eminent Orb, aſpire to contract themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances, whil'ſt is in its Zenith, to ſupport their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94435:59"/> in the World, if it ſhould happen to decline. My Maxims are oppoſite to thoſe of ordinary Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, reply'd <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> I am not ambitious to receive for the full benefit of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s favor towards me, the pleaſure only of flattering my ſelf with the fancy of it: A Roman, who perhaps on terms of equality would eſteem himſelf honor'd by my alliance, will think he offers a glorious Sacrifice to my favor, in demanding my Neece of me. I will not charge my honor with ſo ſcrupulous a vanity, and that I may not render my ſelf ſuſpected of an ambition or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt, whereof my ſoul is uncapable, I would remove from the Court, or incloſe within the grates of a veſtal Cloyſter, all ſuch young Ladies as ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my protection.</p>
               <p>This Declaration produc'd, in the heart of <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidia,</hi> thoſe effects in my favor, which many years ſervices might have deſpair'd of meriting: It mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny'd, and thought it lawful to revolt againſt the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny which was impos'd upon its liberty; and as I am naturally bold, and ambitious of enterprizing difficulties, that which render'd <hi>Helvidia</hi> propitious to my deſires, made them ſoar a pitch likewiſe above the higheſt flight of ordinary Lovers. Yet we judg'd it a part of diſcretion, to conceal our Amour under the ſecureſt diſguiſe we could invent for it. <hi>Mecoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>'s credit commanded a great power with the Emperor, and he might have ſuppreſs'd me by open force, had I attempted to juſtle it. We agreed, the better to delude the <hi>Argus</hi>-ey'd. World, to make Love, as I may ſay, by croſs purpoſes: And then I began to affect that inſenſibility, wherewith a long time <hi>Aurelia</hi> herſelf was deceiv'd ſhe was then a friend of <hi>Helvidia,</hi> but not her confident: And <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidia</hi> was us'd to ſay, that the infallible way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94435:59"/> a ſecret from being betray'd, was alwayes to be the Miſtriſs of it herſelf: I ſaw her oftner at <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>'s apartment, than <hi>Mecoenas</hi>'s; and this private diſguiſe I put upon my viſits, allow'd me the liberty to make them with more frequency and ſecurity. I was much indebted at that time to the generous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of <hi>Aurelia;</hi> ſhe was ignorant of the cauſe that ſo often invited me to her Lodgings, and ſhe is naturally of a ſweet and affable diſpoſition; but I perceiv'd, that this ſweetneſs and this affability, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly gave place to their oppoſite qualities. <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidia</hi> perceiv'd it, as well as I; and without ſeeming to take a particular notice of it, ſhe ask'd her the cauſe. Can you ask me ſuch a queſtion, ſaid <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia?</hi> Have you eyes, and do not ſee, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that young Inſolent treats me? He ſeems to have made choice of me for a Subject, to exerciſe all his incivilities on; he diſdains to give me his hand to lead me in publick; he oppoſes all I ſay, or do; and it is ſufficient to caſt him into a humor of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if I but open my mouth in any place, where he is. <hi>Helvidia</hi> gave me information of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were fram'd againſt me; but though I could not allow them to be juſt, yet I began to carry my ſelf with that reſpect towards <hi>Aurelia,</hi> as I was accuſtom'd to do, when ſhe was beſt ſatisfi'd with my proceedings.</p>
               <p>You muſt force your ſelf, ſaid <hi>Helvidia,</hi> in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of this importance, to act a part contrary to your inclination. We muſt make uſe of the houſe of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> for the place of our interviews: affect a complaiſance to all her deſires, ſpeak all the obliging things to her, a real Amour could dictate. Oh! Madam, ſaid I, interrupting her, you do not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what you command me; it ſo ill becomes a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94435:60"/> perſon of honor to act the Lover, when he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs, that I know not how to expreſs the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my thoughts to you; and you are ſenſible, that the ſame diſorder in the thoughts of another, generally derives its ſource from the Motions of the heart; and all reaſonable creatures, have not alwayes the reaſon to be the Maſters of them. <hi>Helvidia</hi> laugh'd at my ſuſpicions, and gave me a little check for the preſumption I had of my own Merits. My Friend, ſaid ſhe, is too prudent to love firſt; and that which I interpreted a diſorder in the heart, was only a point of nicety, which ſhe conjur'd me to wave, and ſatisfie her requeſt; I obey'd it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor'd to make the will of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> the ſquare of all my actions. I was diligent in paying all thoſe little ſervices to her commands, which can bear the conſtruction of nothing but ordinary civilities to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a perſon, one has not a paſſion for; but do aſſume another character, when Love enters on the Theatre. I applauded all ſhe ſaid, I often took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to extoll her beauty. About this time the Emperor took a progreſs to <hi>Tuſculum,</hi> and as <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> was alwayes the glorious Planet, which was fix'd to the motion of the Court, <hi>Helvidia</hi> was oblig'd to attend her. I diſcontinu'd my uſual viſits to <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>'s apartment in its abſence; but one evening ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the honor to conduct ſome young Ladies, and <hi>Aurelia</hi> amongſt them, to take the air on the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant banks of <hi>Tyber,</hi> they began to reproach me with my pretended inſenſibility; and this railery was the ſubject of the greateſt part of our converſation. I took great pleaſure in acting the part of a faithful Lover, under the perſon of the indifferent; which ſeem'd to be a private ſacrifice offer'd up to the ſhrine of my abſent Miſtriſs; I perceiv'd that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:94435:60"/> did often change colour, and when I preſented her my hand to conduct her to her chariot, ſhe ſeem'd as if ſhe had taken no notice of my civility, and ſo in a regardleſs manner refus'd me hers: But I judg'd it no policy to draw upon me the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of more than <hi>Aurelia,</hi> at that time, for having unadviſedly declar'd before, that I ſuſpected <hi>Aurelia</hi> had had a kindneſs for me, I had been revil'd by them, as a young Fellow puffed up with vanity and ſelf-conceit; I durſt not diſcover my thoughts, but endeavor'd to ſeem ſatisfi'd, that <hi>Aurelia</hi> had not really ſeen me, when I offer'd her my hand. The Emperor return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> the day after. <hi>Helvidia</hi> came to viſit <hi>Aurelia,</hi> as ſoon as ſhe was diſingag'd from <hi>Terentia;</hi> ſhe found her in her Bed, and her voice ſo alter'd, that ſhe judg'd her to be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ill; which put her into ſuch a fright, that ſhe was ſcarce able to ask her, what her diſtemper was? The effect, ſaid <hi>Aurelia,</hi> of the moſt malign influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ever the Heavens produc'd. Ask me no more, for I will rather dye, than make a larger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of my Misfortunes. How? my Dear, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Helvidia,</hi> can <hi>Aurelia</hi> keep any ſecret from <hi>Helvidia?</hi> Can you offer ſo unkind an injury to our friendſhip?</p>
               <p>I deal with our friendſhip, ſaid <hi>Aurelia,</hi> as I wiſh I could deal with my ſelf; would the Gods were pleas'd, that at the expence of my life, I could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal that from my ſelf, which I refuſe to reveal to you; let it ſuffice, that I am the moſt unfortunate of Women. <hi>Helvidia</hi> could gain no other anſwer from her that day, but one or two after ſhe conjur'd her with ſuch vehemency to confide a ſecret to her, which ſo much perplex'd her thoughts, that <hi>Aurelia</hi> ſuffer'd her obſtinacy to be conquer'd by it. You
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94435:61"/> will doubtleſs accuſe <hi>Helvidia</hi> of ſome injuſtice, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with what earneſtneſs ſhe urg'd a freedom from <hi>Aurelia,</hi> which ſhe refus'd to practiſe herſelf; but ſhe had violent preſumptions of the truth, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to be well grounded, they might autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize a ſmall diſſimulation. <hi>Aurelia</hi> drew ſome Tablets out of her Pocket, and having ſtudied a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time to digeſt her conceit, ſhe writ the Verſes I ſhall here recite to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cepion</hi> began to repeat the ſame Verſes, which <hi>Hortenſius</hi> had found before in the Gardens of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus;</hi> but <hi>Hortenſius</hi> interrupting him after two or three words, I am as well acquainted with thoſe Verſes, as your ſelf, ſaid he, and I think I have them ſtill in my poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>You have them not, ſaid <hi>Cepion:</hi> Oh! would it had ſo pleas'd the Gods, that you had kept them. <hi>Helvidia</hi> had a ſtrong preſumption, that I was the Ingrate, thoſe Verſes decyphred; they gave a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of my perſon, ſuch as it could not merit; but the eſteem, wherewith the goodneſs of <hi>Aurelia</hi> was pleas'd to honor me, did doubtleſs render her too partial a Judge in my favor. She propos'd a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand queſtions to <hi>Aurelia,</hi> to draw from her a clear confirmation of her ſuſpicions. <hi>Aurelia</hi>'s amorous diſtractions had reduc'd her to that critical minute, (ſo fam'd amongſt Lovers) wherein the high ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling tyde of Paſſion, will not ſuffer the heart to keep any thing conceal'd within its centre. She made to her a ſincere declaration of the Love ſhe had for me, and in terms ſo paſſionate, that the heart of <hi>Helvidia</hi> was transfix'd with a tender compaſſion of her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. She gave me an account of their converſe the ſame day, in a Garden, where ſhe was waiting upon the Empreſs, as ſhe was taking the air, when I
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94435:61"/> was ſo happy to receive her hand; and as nothing can compare with the ſweetneſs of her nature, it is a great trouble to me, ſaid ſhe, to ſee this poor Lady in that condition you have reduc'd her to: what ſhe has told me, even pierces my very Soul; and I conjure you, by that reſpect you proteſt you have for me, to afford ſome relief to the afflictions ſhe labors under. How? Madam, ſaid I, not a little ſurpriz'd and ſtartled, at her expreſſion, are you weary of my heart, and willing to turn it out of your ſervice? Will you transfer to <hi>Aurelia,</hi> the title and right you have acquir'd over it? I have no ſuch intention, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Helvidia,</hi> your heart is, and ever ſhall be moſt precious to <hi>Helvidia;</hi> but if without infringing my right to that heart, you could by ſome ſmall compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances flatter a little the paſſion of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> I aſſure you, you would lay a ſenſible obligation upon me. Ha! Madam, ſaid I, diſturb'd with the thoughts of ſuch an obligation, I have expreſs'd already but too much of that compliance, you would now again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me to. If from the firſt Moment, I was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the weakneſs of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> I had combated it with all my power, whil'ſt it was young, I had doubtleſs ſuppreſs'd it; but your commands com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd me to careſs, and ſuffer it to gather ſtrength; the ſervices, your orders enjoin'd me to render her, have given that encouragement to her diſtemper'd fancy, that ſhe doubted not, as you know, to expreſs it under her own hand. To violent diſeaſes your Phyſicians are us'd to apply remedies of the ſame nature. I think, I underſtand <hi>Aurelia</hi> perfectly well; ſhe has a heart ſuſceptible of the tendereſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of an amorous Paſſion; ſhe has courage, and firmity of reſolution; and if once the firſt has taken a full poſſeſſion of her Soul, it will be impoſſible to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94435:62"/> remove it; and therefore the beſt expedient would be, to pluck it up, and cruſh it, before it has taken too deep a root. Do not think upon ſo violent a courſe, ſaid <hi>Helvidia;</hi> time will cure <hi>Aurelia</hi>'s diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, without the help of ſo rough a Phyſitian. She has virtue; ſhe underſtands, that from <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhe muſt expect a husband; and I do not deſire you, to flatter her Paſſion out of any doubt I have, that ſhe will not be able to ſurmount it without your aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but becauſe I apprehend, the viſible marks of your neglect do inflame and exaſperate the wound, ſhe has unfortunately receiv'd. I would have you allow her virtue time to act according to its own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, and owe the conqueſt to its ſelf. I objected many things more to <hi>Helvidia,</hi> to make her ſenſible of the danger, to which her compaſſion expos'd us, but all my remonſtrances were to no effect: She car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd me the next day to <hi>Aurelia,</hi> and charg'd me with greater apprehenſions of her danger, than I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd before; ſhe made a ſign to me with her eye, to maintain that in my diſcourſe, which ſhe thought convenient to advance in hers; and when ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd I was refractory to her commands, ſhe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, by the ſudden alteration of her countenance, a diſpleaſure, which had almoſt congeal'd my blood within my veins; and like a ſullen cloud, totally eclips'd the uſual ſerenity of her ſmiling affability even to the very day, you had that long conference with the Emperor. You may judge by what I tell you to day, that I told you no untruth then, when I aſſur'd you, that I had employ'd my utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to inveſt you in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Aurelia.</hi> I was ſo perſecuted with the importune compaſſion of <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidia,</hi> that I could have given any thing that was moſt dear to me in the world, beſides herſelf, to have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94435:62"/> a ſhort truce from it. It was from the Mouth of <hi>Helvidia,</hi> that your Miſtriſs firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that act of generoſity your expreſs'd in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to the Emperor, <hi>Helvidia</hi> being then with <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia,</hi> when <hi>Caeſar</hi> reported it to her. Oh! cruel Gods! exclaim'd <hi>Aurelia,</hi> in a dolorous Note (when the Niece of <hi>Mecoen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Oh! cruel <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> (went ſhe on, with a torrent of tears flowing from her eyes) why art thou ſo unkind, to intrude ſuch bitter reſentments in amongſt thoſe inſupportable afflictions, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready overcharge me? Theſe reſentments may not be unprofitable, reply'd <hi>Helvidia,</hi> if you would but a little conſult your reaſon, <hi>Hortenſius</hi> is a perſon, in whom Merit and Love contend for the nobler title; and if the generous reſignation, he has made of his own deſires unto yours, has on his part pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected you from a husband, oppoſite to the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your own will, you will not be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect your ſelf long from one, whom anothers will ſhall impoſe upon them. <hi>Caeſar</hi> is oblig'd to offer a husband to the Couſin German of the great <hi>Julius,</hi> and it is not probable, that he will caſt his regards upon <hi>Cepion,</hi> to honor him with that alliance. The charges and dignities, which he will annex to the poſſeſſion of your perſon, will require a Man of more experience to ſupport their weight and luſtre, than the Ingrate, you love, is capable of. Ought not the violence, you will be forc'd ſooner or later to impoſe upon your inclinations, to ſeem leſs cruel to you on the part of a generous perſon, whoſe adorations you
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94435:63"/> have often before receiv'd at your feet, than on that of ſome proud moroſe ſtranger, you never ſaw? Go on, my Dear, ſaid, the languiſhing <hi>Aurelia</hi> to <hi>Helvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> go on, and made me underſtand what I owe to the generoſity of <hi>Hortenſius:</hi> I with ſcorn entertain'd that Love, he has given me ſo many glorious proofs of; I forbid him my houſe, and in the height of all theſe ill treats he has receiv'd from me, he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to take a juſt revenge of my abuſes: make me ſenſible what care and regard he had of my honor, when I had ſo little for it my ſelf. He might have diſcover'd to the Emperor, the paſſion I had for his Rival; he knew it, and my carriage towards him, did not oblige him to conceal it, yet he never gave him the leaſt intimation of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ovid</hi> came in, as <hi>Cepion</hi> was in this part of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; See, ſaid he to <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> preſenting to him the two ſtrangers, if I do not deſerve the honor of being ſent forth upon all expeditions for diſcoveries? Have you ever ſeen a nobler couple, than here I bring before you? <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> with much impatience, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fir'd to hear the end of <hi>Cepion</hi>'s diſcourſe, and <hi>Ovid</hi> had not oblig'd him, by coming to interrupt it: But as he was a perſon of the greateſt civility in the world to ſtrangers, and thoſe which were preſented to him being of that quality, as to attract his chiefeſt conſideration, he receiv'd them with all the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of a courteous welcom. You obſerve, and doubtleſs not without admiration, ſaid <hi>Ovid</hi> to <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius,</hi> addreſſing a Salute to the Brother of <hi>Roſeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> that this young unknown is a Maſculine Beauty in our Sex: you need but caſt your eyes upon him, to confirm your remark; for the firſt fight of him was like to have made me turn Idolater, and offer incenſe to an unknown Deity. But your admiration
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94435:63"/> will be greater, when I ſhall tell you, that it is not his perſon only which ought to render him thus worthy of your conſideration; you behold in him that young <hi>Herennius,</hi> the apprehenſion of whoſe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy, caus'd the fair <hi>Herennia</hi> to attempt ſo auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious an enterprize. <hi>Cepion</hi> preſently knew <hi>Heren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> to be the ſame, whom <hi>Ovid</hi> ſpoke of, he gave him a thouſand careſſes; and the three <hi>Romans</hi> thought it convenient to ſend for <hi>Lentulus,</hi> to take his part in ſo fortunate an encounter. <hi>Hertenſius</hi> order'd a Servant to go to him, and to inquire pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately likewiſe, if <hi>Roſelina</hi> were at home. I ſhall be aſham'd to look that great General in the face, ſaid <hi>Herennius</hi> to <hi>Cepion;</hi> the manner whereby I reb'd him by my flight of a Priſoner, (whom the Laws of <hi>Mars</hi> had conſign'd into his power, and his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity accumulated with his favors) carries with it the too juſt Marks of an ingratitude; which would inviron me with ſhame and confuſion, did not the cauſe of my offence plead its own excuſe. Behold there, Sir, ſaid he, ſhewing him the fair ſtranger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Motive, which ſummon'd me from your Camp, to give my attendance in another place; my firſt chains diſcharg'd me of your ſecond; and I had a Maſter to whoſe commands my liberty was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, before the fortune of War had captivated it to yours. I muſt be forc'd to acknowledge before this company, ſaid the Lady, interrupting him, that thou haſt a great opinion of my diſcretion, or a very ſmall one of thy own, ſince thou doſt preſume with ſuch confidence to boaſt of the injuries I have receiv'd from thee. Thou hopeſt perhaps that the preſence of theſe perſons, whom I know all to be <hi>Romans,</hi> will impoſe a conſtraint upon my juſt reſentments, but when they know their character, as well as thou
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94435:64"/> doſt, they will conclude them to be too full of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to bear a Moderation. I will ſpeak, I will utter all that a juſt deſpight can prompt to the Soul of a Lover unworthily betray'd; and violating the Laws of ſilence, as thou haſt done thoſe of honor and fidelity, I ſhall be more excuſable, as a <hi>Grecian,</hi> in publiſhing to the World the ſhame of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> than thou, as a <hi>Roman</hi> by extraction, in diſhonoring the houſe of thy Emperor. Theſe words were like ſo many fiery darts, that carry'd flames of jealouſie and diſtraction into the breaſt of <hi>Ovid;</hi> his ſuſpicions would indulge no quiet to his reſtleſs thoughts; I am better read in Love, than you, ſaid he to <hi>Heren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> (who was ready to reply to the reproaches of the fair <hi>Greek;</hi>) you ought never to attempt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the rigor of your Miſtriſs by a contentious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, we muſt allow all Women in general the liberty of their ſmart Repartees, and to thoſe, we love, a prerogative in that nature, above thoſe, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to us. Give me leave to give ſome inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the beauteous <hi>Agaritha,</hi> and do you ſecond them by a reſpectful ſilence, which perhaps may prove a better Orator in your cauſe, than your tongue. In ſaying this, he took <hi>Agaritha</hi>'s hand, and led her up to a Terraſs, which afforded a pleaſant proſpect to the Sea, hoping by ſome curious queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to gain from her a diſcovery of the ſubject of her indignation; but <hi>Herennius</hi> underſtanding from the two <hi>Romans,</hi> that the perſon who had made that diſcourſe to him, was the famous <hi>Ovid,</hi> he foliow'd him up to the Terraſs. You are a Judge too renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the caſe of Love-differences, ſaid he to him, not to be fear'd by the guilty; and therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give my conſent, that my fair Enemy ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingage you in favor of her cauſe; but if you muſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94435:64"/> underſtand what the crimes are wherewith the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, me, and whereof in effect I am partly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, I had rather make an ingenuous confeſſion of them my ſelf, than ſuffer her to aggravate them in the recital. That which you are now going to make, ſaid <hi>Ovid,</hi> is too criminal a ſecret, I fear, to find a favorable Judge. Sit you down upon that ſtony bench, (added he, in cauſing him to ſit) and make a ſincere confeſſion to us of all your faults, and perhaps we may prove ſo fortunate Advocates for you to this fair one, as to obtain your pardon; and your ſtory will be the moſt agreeable diverſion, we can paſs the time with, till the arrival of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe company we have ſent to beg, to honor yours. <hi>Herennius</hi> would not give them the trouble of an important intreaty, and <hi>Hortenſius</hi> thinking that his Relation would be ſoon interrupted by the coming of <hi>Lentulus,</hi> was ſatisfi'd to defer the ſequel of <hi>Cepion</hi>'s till a little longer time; the company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all plac'd upon the Terraſs, the charming <hi>Heren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> began his diſcourſe in this manner.</p>

               <head>THE HISTORY OF <hi>Herennius</hi> and <hi>Agaritha.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis illuſtrious Lady, ſaid he, pointing to <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritha,</hi> has honor'd the Iſle of <hi>Lesbos</hi> with her birth, and is deſcended in a direct maſculine Line from the firſt Princes of <hi>Greece.</hi> I learnt my exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes in the Capitol City of this Iſland, where the Father of <hi>Agaritha</hi> made his ordinary reſidence. I ſaw <hi>Agaritha,</hi> and as it is ſcarce poſſible to ſee her, and not love her, my youthful heart without reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance yielded up its liberty to the firſt of her regards. The Nobility of her deſcent borrows no ſupport from the favors of Fortune, which has endow'd it but with ſmall poſſeſſions, and this did facilitate the Suit I made to her Parents for their conſent. Our Marriage was concluded, and my felicity was no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be defer'd, than to the happy Minute, I ſhould be able to make good what I had propos'd. I took one of <hi>Agaritha</hi>'s chief Relations along with me to the Frontiers of the <hi>Getes,</hi> where the ſcatter'd relics of all that ſmall wealth, the Misfortunes of our Houſe had left me, was depoſited. I fell ſick in this journey, but as I had propos'd nothing, but what
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94435:65"/> truth could atteſt for me, the Parents of <hi>Agaritha</hi> thought her ſo well beſtow'd upon me, that they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd all imaginable diligence to haſten the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of my felicity. The weakneſs my ſickneſs had left upon me, would not permit me to return to <hi>Lesbos,</hi> as ſoon as the impatience of my love deſir'd; whereupon the <hi>Grecian,</hi> I had in my company, ſeeing the will of the Gods themſelves, had diſpens'd with my duty in ſo fatal an occaſion, conjur'd by my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent intreaties, engag'd his faith to me, to re-inſtate me in the poſſeſſion of my Miſtriſs: ſhe had been ſolemnly betroth'd to me before; and I on my part renew'd to him all the moſt ſacred aſſurances, I was in that circumſtance capable to make. Upon this intelligence, my Miſtriſs did me the honor to leave <hi>Lesbos,</hi> to come to the place where the Malice of my diſtemper forc'd me to attend her. Her ſhort Sea-Voyage was fortunate; I advanc'd, as well as I was able to meet her, and hop'd in a few dayes to join her; when I underſtood that a Party of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army had ſurpriz'd her, and carry'd her away Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner amongſt many others, on whom they impoſe the infamous title of Slaves. I leave you to judge, what a relapſe this news reduc'd me to. I ſent to the Captain of the Slaves, to petition him that <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritha</hi> might be expos'd to ranſom, and I would have redeem'd her at the expence of all that Fortune had left me in the world. But my Miſtriſs was a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure above a ranſom; ſhe was deſign'd for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and a Convoy was ready to conduct her to <hi>Rome.</hi> This barbarous inhumanity heighten'd my former diſtemper to a perfect phrenſie. I put my ſelf in the head of ſome revolted <hi>Getes,</hi> and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting I was of <hi>Roman</hi> blood, I atchiev'd ſuch honor againſt the Army, <hi>Lentulus</hi> commanded, that I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94435:66"/> the name of <hi>Roſelin,</hi> (which I aſſum'd, and was the name of my Uncle by my Mothers ſide, I both famous, and redoubted to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Love and Revenge inſpiring me with courage, I out-bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved temerity itſelf. I attempted to ſet the Priſoners at liberty, they were hurrying away to <hi>Rome;</hi> in which audacious enterprize, I was taken my ſelf, and deſign'd for one of thoſe memorable Examples by which <hi>Lentulus</hi> hop'd to conquer the obſtinacy of the rebellious <hi>Getes.</hi> You have heard by what means I was deliver'd from that danger; and how <hi>Lentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> who is really endu'd with a brave Soul, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly embrac'd that opportunity, to reduce thoſe Opiniatres by the principles of a generous Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity. He reſtor'd to me the name of my Anceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, to extinguiſh that of a Gladiator out of my thoughts, which I was ready to be branded with. He offer'd me Employs in his Army; and if I had been only a Rebel, I might have been the inſeparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of his fortune and glory; but I was a Lover, and reſolv'd to ſacrifice a thouſand Lives, had I been Maſter of them, or free <hi>Agarithas</hi> from the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious chains of her ſlavery. I durſt not impart my deſign to <hi>Lentulus,</hi> who pretended a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for my ſiſter; and I was afraid, that the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he expreſs'd to me, would have caus'd him to have oppos'd a bar againſt my dangerous reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Whereupon I privately deluded the obliging care, <hi>Lentulus</hi> had of me, and ſtealing in diſguiſe out of his Camp, ſometimes committing my flight to Sea, ſometimes to Land, according to the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences I could meet with for ſpeedy travel, I at length arriv'd at the Suburbs of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had by my diligence prevented the ſlow Motions of the Slaves, who were not yet come; nor ſuffer'd to take
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94435:66"/> long Journies, for fear of impairing their Beauty, and Complections, by the laborious toils of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Travel. The name of <hi>Herennius</hi> was not yet defac'd out of the memory of true <hi>Romans,</hi> and I had Relations in <hi>Italy,</hi> who I hop'd, would not diſown their own Blood; I beſides repos'd great confidence in the favor of <hi>Lentulus,</hi> if I ſhould have occaſion to make uſe of it; and above all, I aſſur'd my ſelf of the Juſtice and Equity of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> I entertain'd my ſelf with theſe pleaſing fancies all the way betwixt <hi>Tuſculum</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the Road, by which the Slaves were to make their triumphal Entry into the City; when I diſcover'd coming forth of the Suburbs thereof a rich and magnificent Chariot, with a proud Guard attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: I ſtopt to take a view of it, when a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious young Lady, who was ſeated in it, putting her Head by accident out of the door, on the ſide that I was of, happen'd to caſt her eye upon me from whence ſhe did not remove it in a good ſpace; and then expreſſing a geſture of admiration, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, ſaid ſhe to another Lady, who was with her, that this is the original of my excellent Peice, I value ſo much. At thſe words ſhe commanded, the Chariot to ſtop, and making me a Sign to come to her, askt me who I was. I am a <hi>Roman,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid I, though fortune has made me and my Country long Strangers to each other. What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion are you of? reply'd ſhe. I ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Honor of a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, ſaid I, but through ſome misfortunes, the recital whereof would require too long an Audience; my profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at preſent is that of a Knight really Errant, who fears he ſhall never arrive to a happy end of his Adventures.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:94435:67"/>
               <p>A Cavalier, who ſeem'd to have the conduct of the party that convoy'd her, approach'd the Chariot with a low and reſpectful bow, and humbly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the Lady who ſpoke to me, to conſider, that he ſhould incur the Emperors diſpleaſure, if he did not conduct her to <hi>Tuſculum</hi> in good time; whereupon, with an obliging bow of her head, taking as it were her leave of me, ſhe commanded her Coachman to drive on. I went to ſome Slaves, who run by the Chariot ſide, to inform my ſelf who the Lady was, that had diſcourſed with me. Who is ſhe? anſwered they, with looks expreſſing an admiration of my ignorance; Do you not know the Emperors Daughter? you have all ſeen the Princeſs <hi>Julia;</hi> you know what dazeling Rayes ſhe darts from her eyes into thoſe of all ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her; the complaiſant ſweetneſs of her carriage, and the mellifluous Charms which with her Words flow from her Lips. What concern, ſaid I to my ſelf, can the Daughter of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> have with thee, a Paſſenger, whom ſhe accidentally meets upon a common Road? Why ſhould ſhe make a ſtop to talk to thee? Why ſhould ſhe ask what Country or Profeſſion thou wert of? It was not <hi>Julia</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, thou did'ſt ſee, it was a Viſion without doubt; and what thou did'ſt take to be a real Encounter, was nothing but a deluding Dream. I underſtood by mine Hoſt where I lodged, that the Emperor had commanded the Princeſs his Daughter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to <hi>Tuſculum</hi> upon a difference, which ſhe had had with the Prince <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whom both himſelf and the whole Empire deſigned for her Husband. And a few days after I was inform'd by common report, that the ſame Prince had caſt himſelf at <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Feet, to obtain a repeal of thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:94435:67"/> and that the ſame day the Princeſs was to return to the Court. I had a deſire to ſee her make her entry, and out of an itch of vanity, or more properly infidelity, which I have a thouſand times ſince accus'd with an unfeined grief and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, I took care to appear more ſplendid and conſpicuous than ordinary. As ſhe alighted out of her Chariot, the Prince <hi>Marcellus</hi> gave her his hand, to conduct her to her Chamber. I preſſed amongſt others to ſee her; ſhe again took notice of me, and made the like Sign to me, as ſhe had done before, upon the Road to <hi>Tuſculum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This exceſs of Civility in the firſt Princeſs of the Univerſe, and towards a perſon of no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, nor Note, ſtruck me with an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I am not capable to expreſs. I inſinuated my ſelf into the acquaintance of one of her At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, who was a Kinſman of mine Hoſt, and he promiſed me to admit me to to the ſight of the Princeſs, at the next convenient opportunity: and one day, when ſhe was walking by the River <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> with no other Company than her Maids of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, he came and advertis'd me of it. I haſtn'd thither with ſpeed, and us'd all my endeavors to render my ſelf remarkable to her; which was not difficult to be effected. <hi>Julia,</hi> as you know, has an action very airy and free, and her eyes, like Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers to her Greatneſs, take up all places where ſhe is, for their entertainment: They had ſoon found me, and their Princeſs askt me, if I were not the perſon, whom ſhe had ſeen upon the way, as ſhe was going to <hi>Tuſculum.</hi> Yes, Madam, ſaid I, I am the ſame, who charm'd with your Bounties All-divine, would willingly ſacrifice my deſpicable life to the juſt acknowledgments, my meanneſs
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:94435:68"/> ſhall always be oblig'd to pay to them. Preſerve your life for ſome worthier occaſion, reply'd the Princeſs, ſmiling upon me, I am no lover of bloody Sacrifices, and it would be a great loſs to the World, that a perſon of your Meen and Compoſure, ſhould be ſnatcht out of it in the flower of his Youth. She ſeem'd to be ſenſibly toucht with all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate paſſages of my Relation, and interrupting me, as I was repeating that of my Siſters bold En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; I cannot applaud, ſaid ſhe, this Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Bravery in Women; it is ſo juſt a Propriety of the other Sex, that methinks, it is always an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural uſurpation in ours, what pretence ſoever you color it with. But, I cannot deny, but the action of <hi>Herennia</hi> has I know not what of heroick in it, which infinitely pleaſes me; and I will ſerve you for your Siſters ſake. Come ſee me to morrow, added ſhe, ſeeing the Prince <hi>Marcellus</hi> at a diſtance, who was coming to wait upon her. I ſolemnly proteſt, and too often have I made this ſolemn proteſtation to the jealous and revengeful <hi>Agaritha,</hi> that the ſupernatural Graces of that Princeſs, did with their luſtre, dazle and charm all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my Soul. But I call the Divinity of Love to witneſs, who is, and ever was, my moſt adored Deity, that all the time I mention, I never had any other regard for this Princeſs, but as I hop'd by her favor to arrive at a means to obtain the liberty of <hi>Agaritha;</hi> but I oon had cauſe to believe, that the Heavens envyed me the pleaſure I took in the thoughts of that hopeful deſign; for I was told at the Slave-Office, which I viſited every hour of the day and night, that thoſe which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the <hi>Getiſh</hi> Camp, were Shipwrackt; and that ſo inconſiderable a number of them had
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:94435:68"/> eſcap'd, that it was not thought worth the trouble of ſending them to <hi>Rome.</hi> I askt with ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a deathful deſpair in my countenance, whether a beautiful <hi>Grecian,</hi> named <hi>Agaritha,</hi> were in the Catalogue of the living, of the dead. The names are not yet known of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

I thought this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal News would have put a period to my life; the conformation whereof a day or two after, had almoſt induc'd me to employ my Sword to effect what my grief was too ſlow in executing. This fatal accident had totally rais'd the character of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaes</hi> Charms out of my memory; I had no other thoughts than of reſtoring to my Siſter an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Brother, who was now the ſole ſupport and Guardian of her Orphan Beauty, and I left my melancholy quarters to ſeek a convenience for my journy, when paſſing through the Piazza, which is before the Pantheon, I ſaw the Princeſs, who was then come out of that Temple, walking under ſome Trees, which in pleaſant Walks, are rang'd before it. She diſcover'd me almoſt, as ſoon as I had her; and commanding her Servants to call me unto her; What is the reaſon, ſaid ſhe, you did not come to me, as I order'd you? Alas, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, anſwer'd I, with tears ready to ſtart out of my eyes, I have no more need of the protection, you did me the honor to promiſe me; <hi>Agaritha,</hi> for whom alone I thought to have taken the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to have beg'd it, is no longer in the World. Is it poſſible, reply'd the Princeſs, that any body ſhould be ſo much concern'd for the death of a perſon, they defign'd for a Wife? You have
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94435:69"/> not had time to practice with <hi>Agaritha</hi> one of thoſe Intrigues, which gives Love that firmity of ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Soul of Lovers; you demanded her in Marriage upon the very firſt motions of your Love; and obtained her upon the firſt of your demands, did you not, of her Parents? Yes, Madam, ſaid I, interrupting her, with more tranſport than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; but the injurious Heaven forbid the Banes of my felicity. That's nothing, ſaid the Princeſs, you have not had ſufficient proof, or knowledge of her, to deſire her poſſeſſion with that vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and ardor, you pretend; Do not leave <hi>Rome,</hi> for Heaven ſeem'd to charge me with your protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conduct, when it offer'd you to my view upon the Road to <hi>Tuſculum;</hi> we want not fair La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies here, to whom you may devote your ſelf, without the conſent or diſpleaſure of <hi>Hymen.</hi> But, Madam, ſaid I, if I may dare to preſume to be of an opinion repugnant to yours, I ſhould affirm, that you impoſe upon me the moſt rigorous Law, that Man is capable of being bound to: For can a Lover be confin'd to a deſtiny more ſevere, than an irrefragable deſpair, of ever poſſeſſing his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs? You are dull of apprehenſion, ſaid <hi>Julia,</hi> I wiſh you nothing leſs, than a rigorous deſtiny; ſtay in <hi>Rome,</hi> I tell you; and if you pleaſe, you may add your ſelf to the number of divers young Gentlemen, who without the ſtipend of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Service, are entertain'd in my Family.

                  </gap>arks of an humble joy and reſpect; and the chiefeſt employ of thoſe places, was to exhibit an obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious diligence and aſſidnity towards her perſon. The firſt day that I was to give my attendance, I was ſtruck with wonder to find in the Princeſſes
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94435:69"/> Cloſet the Portraiture of a <hi>Cupid,</hi> which I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to be drawn by an exquiſite hand at <hi>Lesbos,</hi> and deliver'd to my Miſtreſſes. She obſerv'd my admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; you know this Piece, I ſee, ſaid ſhe to me; and I believ'd the firſt moment I ſaw you, that you could not be a Stranger to it. I know it moſt aſſuredly, Madam, ſaid I, but cannot imagine how it ſhould come to the honor of being in the place, where I ſee it. If the perſon that plac'd it here, ſaid a Lady, interrupting our diſcourſe (whom the Princeſs had a particular reſpect for, and I knew afterwards to be <hi>Sulpicia</hi>) had imagin'd it would have produc'd the effects it has done, would have been better advis'd, than to have brought it hither. Theſe words dy'd the Princeſs Cheeks with a ſcarlet bluſh, and caſting an angry look upon her, Muſt you always be talking of that Man? ſaid ſhe to her; are you not ſatisfi'd, that he has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd a quarrel already? But you will have him as well preſent as abſent, create a new one betwixt us. Ha! my dear Princeſs, reply'd <hi>Sulpicia,</hi> in a rallying tone, if that which I ſay to day, attracts your diſpleaſure upon me, it muſt be for ſome cauſe far different from that, which would have attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſome days ago. Who can forbear, went ſhe on ſmiling, to ſmile a little ſometimes at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant manner, whereby we ſee Love play with the Policy of Lovers? This perſon of ſo eminent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience makes you a preſent of a Picture of Love, to the end, ſays he, that the repreſentation of the God of Love, ſhould preſerve in your thoughts the memory of the Lover: And for this cauſe he conjures you to caſt your eyes often upon the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; and becauſe you have too often comply'd with his deſires, you how grow quarrelſome with
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:94435:70"/> me. You will never leave this idle raillery, ſaid <hi>Julia,</hi> clapping her hand before <hi>Sulpiciaes</hi> Mouth; let us talk no more neither of the effects it has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, nor the party that gave it us.</p>
               <p>The Relation of <hi>Herennius</hi> was here interrupted by one of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Slaves, who came running up the Terraſs with a more than ordinary ſpeed. Oh! ye good and mighty gods, cry'd he out, I give you thanks, that the News is not true— Of what News talk you? ſaid <hi>Ovid;</hi> and what makes you interrupt us in this rude manner? Sir, reply'd the Slave, pardon me, for I am yet quite beſides my ſelf. I went along cloſe by the Sea-ſhore, to ſee if I could diſcover any Marks of a Combat, which I was told, had been newly fought there; where I found <hi>Tiſienus,</hi> who, methoughts had ſomething of diſmal and horrid in his countenance; he knew me to belong to you. Go boy, ſaid he, and bury thy Maſters body, who has now receiv'd the juſt r ward of all his Crimes. I was not able for a while to ſtir any limb I had, at the apprehenſion of theſe mournful words, and ſeeing <hi>Tiſienus</hi> make haſtily away from me, after he had ſpoke them, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to follow him, to gain a clearer under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them; but he went ſo faſt, and my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize had ſo diſarm'd my legs of their ſtrength, that I could not poſſibly overtake him. Fortune guided me hither, where, thanks to Heaven, I find, that <hi>Tiſienus</hi> has only made a trial of my love to my Maſter. <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> and <hi>Ovid</hi> lookt one upon another at this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Slave; which included more than one Myſtery, but they could not on a ſudden penetrate into the conſequence; for one of <hi>Hortenſius</hi> his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants came all in a fright, to tell him, that <hi>Lentulus</hi> was newly murder'd in one of the Walks of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94435:70"/> Wilderneſs, and carried home to his houſe. <hi>Cepion</hi> ran thither, and the reſt of the Company followed him; where they found <hi>Herennia, Adiamante,</hi> and <hi>Junia,</hi> at the foot of the Stairs. The young <hi>Heren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> knew his Siſter by the light of the Torches, which diſplay'd a glorious day over all the houſe; he was agreeably ſurpriz'd at ſo much a deſir'd, but little expected Encounter. He ran to her with open Arms, and incircling her in his tender embraces: <hi>Herennia,</hi> ſaid he, my dear Siſter, have I found you in this barbarous Iſland! <hi>Herennia</hi> was ſtartled at the action of her Brother, but coming to know him, and the name of Siſter, which he pronounc'd, confirming the report of her eyes, Ah! <hi>Herennius!</hi> Oh! my dear Brother, ſaid ſhe, bedewing his Cheeks with her overflowing Tears, in what a deplorable condition do you find me? Her redoubled fighs would not ſuffer her to utter a word more. They all went up together to the Chamber of the wounded <hi>Lentulus.</hi> He had then fortunately with him a very skilful Surgeon, whom he had brought from the <hi>Getiſh</hi> Camp: This man with ſuch good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs employ'd his Art, that in a ſhort time he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd him out of an (almoſt) mortal ſwound, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which his great loſs of blood had caſt him. He ſearcht a deep wound, which he had a little above his Heart, and was judg'd by him to have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with a Ponyard, <hi>Herennia</hi> aſſiſted his labor with a ſorrowful diligence, which reduc'd her to a weakneſs almoſt equal, to that, of the expiring <hi>Lentulus;</hi> and thinking that in the countenance of the Surgeon, ſhe had diſcover'd the wound to be mortal, ſhe gave a loud ſhreek, and was dropping in a ſwound into the Arms of <hi>Adiamante. Lentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> turn'd his languiſhing eyes towards the place,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:94435:71"/> from whence the cry was ſent; and ſeeing <hi>Herennia</hi> ready to drown her labouring Soul in a torrent of her own tears; It is not to me, Madam, ſaid he, with a feeble Voice, that you ſacrifice thoſe preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tears, but to the deſpight of having been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of a more pretious aſſignation. <hi>Heren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> redoubled her cries at this reproach of her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and turning her ſelf towards <hi>Junia,</hi> ſee, ſaid ſhe, at how dear a rate I purchaſe your friendſhip. When I underſtood by the return of my Slave, that the Ticket, I writ to <hi>Ovid,</hi> came to <hi>Lentulus</hi> his hand, I apprehended ſome diſmal effect of our folly. I ſought after <hi>Lentulus</hi> all day, to free him from the diſquiet, I fear'd that Billet would beget in him: But alas! I could not find him, till his fury had fore-ſtall'd my deſigned prevention. But tell me, cruel one, ſaid ſhe, caſting a tender regard upon her wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lover, tell me, has the character of my Love left no impreſſion in thy Heart, able to ballance this weak ſhadow of an infidelity? What have I done? What have I ſaid, ſince the firſt moment thou haſt known me, that ſhould induce thee to believe, that it is ſo eaſie for my heart to turn Traitor, and abjure its firſt principles? <hi>Ovid,</hi> who as ſoon as he heard himſelf nam'd, had advanc'd towards them, to inform himſelf on what occaſion his name was introduc'd into the Scene, addreſt his Suit to the diſconſolate <hi>Herennia;</hi> but ſhe turning her head away on the other ſide, and thruſting him from her with her hand, retire out of my ſight, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, <hi>Ovid,</hi> ſaid ſhe; your preſence does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate my afflictions; ask <hi>Junia</hi> an account of what you deſire to know.</p>

               <p>The Emperor had for ſome days ſo totally dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his diſquiet thoughts to his reſentments againſt his Daughter <hi>Julia,</hi> that he had not time to make any ſerious reflection upon the Combat of <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Ovid.</hi> He regarded it at firſt, as the effect only of ſome private quarrel; but a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe conſideration afterwards repreſenting to his memory the hour and place of that nocturnal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, perſuaded him, that nothing but Love could have ſo ill contriv'd the circumſtances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Theſe thoughts poſſeſt him with a furious indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94435:72"/> for he imagin'd, that if Love oblig'd them both to draw their Swords, both were equally guilty of an audacious preſumption, in making love to the Daughter of their Emperor: And not being able to digeſt the affront, a Subject ſhould put upon him, in daring to croſs a deſign, he had form'd in favor of <hi>Marcellus:</hi> he gave command that <hi>Craſſus</hi> ſhould be ſecur'd, and all his Papers and Writings ſeiz'd, and brought to him: They gave him no information of what he thought to have found in them; but they diſcover'd ſome other things of an equal concernment to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Amongſt a great many Papers of Love-verſes, which <hi>Craſſus</hi> had dedicated to <hi>Terentia,</hi> he found ſome fragments of a Letter, wherein he read the following Lines.
<q>Employ all your poſſible endeavors to cure your friend of his Paſſion; The Heart of <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> is fixt upon an object, from which no power is able to remove it. I dare not commit his name, to the hazard of Paper; but let it ſatisfie you, that though I do not declare him to be the party you ſuſpect, it is one than whom the Earth cannot preſent a worthier to her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperor was highly inflam'd at the ſight of theſe Lines; he could not apply to himſelf the expreſſion of a Lover, or worthy to be belov'd: for his Paſſion for <hi>Terentia</hi> was now no Secret; and it could not be ſaid of him, that he was not one of thoſe Lovers, which might be ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>He went muſing, and biting the Lip into one of the Gardens of his Palace, whither he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Agrippa</hi> to follow him; and after ſome moments

Some young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or other, who brings no other Charms with him, than the variety of a new Lover, has made this ingrateful One forget what ſhe owes to the Maſter of the World; which corrodes my Heart with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal reſentments; and it is a ſecond trouble to me to be deſtitute of a perſon, to whom I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them; and I could wiſh to find in <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> a Soul ſo ſenſible of the Paſſion, his Emperor labors under, that he might judge him worthy of that confidence, he is willing to repoſe in him I hope, Sir, reply'd <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that it is not ſo abſolutely neceſſary for <hi>Agrippa</hi> to be verſt in all the Myſteries of Love, that without thoſe Maxims his Emperor cannot judge him worthy of any confidence: But, Great Sir, grant me your permiſſion to tell you, that you do an injuſtice to the Wife of <hi>Mecoenas;</hi> that ſhe never lov'd any perſon but <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and that all appearances oppoſite to her fidelity, are either Chimera's, or Forgeries. Read this, ſaid the Emperor, giving <hi>Agrippa</hi> the Paper, which had ſo much embroil'd his thoughts; and when you
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94435:73"/> have perus'd it, tell me, if I have done <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> an injury in ſuſpecting her fidelity.</p>
               <p>The ſight of it put <hi>Agrippa</hi> to the bluſh the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, who ſtanding a while, as if he had been in ſuſpence what to anſwer; but at laſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming courage, I am entring perhaps into a way, Sir, ſaid he, to hazard the total ruin of that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, you are pleas'd to honor me with: for the Hearts of Sovereigns, are places ſo tender and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, that he that preſumes to touch them, incurs an emiment danger of his own head; but <hi>Agrippa</hi> will rather renounce his life, than behold his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror involv'd in a perplexity, which in a few ſyllables he is able to diſſipate; I muſt therefore beg your pardon, Sir, a ſecond time, to tell you, that you unjuſtly ſuſpect the loyalty of <hi>Terentia.</hi> And that you may not doubt the reality of what I aver, I am the perſon whom this Paper adviſes to cure himſelf of his Paſſion.

Yes, Sir, reply'd <hi>Agrippa,</hi> I am the ſame perſon; And perhaps this temerity may plead before your Greatneſs, its juſtification in a moments diſcourſe, if you ſhall be pleas'd not to diſdain it an Audience; Which was of too ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a concern to <hi>Caeſar</hi> to be deferr'd. Wherefore entring into a Grot that was near him, he ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that he could not too ſoon diſſipate the ſullen Cloud, which hung over him; when <hi>Agrippa</hi> began his diſcourſe in this manner.</p>

               <head>THE HISTORY OF Agrippa.</head>
               <p>I Shall not, Sir, juſtifie before you my Paſſion for the Wife of <hi>Mecoenas:</hi> he is my friend; he merits the particular eſteem of all whom he honors with his friendſhip; and though nothing could render him worthy of it, but the favor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you dignifie him, that alone ought to attract to him the reſpect and veneration of the whole Empire: But, Sir, you are ſenſible your ſelf of the Charms of <hi>Terentia,</hi> you are not ignorant of the effects they produce, and how much a Miracle it would be not to forget in her preſence all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations that ought to balance the power of her Beauty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ovid</hi> firſt caus'd my Soul to take a particular cogniſance of that, which it had always endeavor'd to conceal from it ſelf. We were one evening walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by the <hi>Tyber</hi> ſide, where <hi>Ovid</hi> produc'd a new Work of his compoſure, and was reading it to me; when <hi>Terentia,</hi> who with divers other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94435:74"/> had made choice likewiſe of her Walk on the ſame ſide, paſt by us.</p>
               <p>Oh! that divine Creature, ſaid <hi>Ovid,</hi> transfixt as it were with admiration, thoſe enchanting eyes, that ſweet air, thoſe tempting lips, that charming countenance, in fine, that perfect contexture, and epitome of all Beauty. You pay but half a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to that Divinity, ſaid I, interrupting him, you ought to have ſpoken of the vivacity of her Wit, that ingenious and pleaſant raillery, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe ſeaſons the moſt ſerious Affairs; that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of Speech, and that Eloquence, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtudy, and ſometimes her own knowledge, flows from her lips, with that natural grace, that our greateſt Orators may gather from them the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Flowers, which embelliſh their Art. It is very pleaſant methinks, ſaid <hi>Ovid,</hi> ſmiling in my face, to ſee you add ſo glorious a varniſh to the firſt draught of my rude Pencil; and I have believ'd a long time, that a perſon of the temper of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> could not every day converſe with the Wife of <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> and not reſign to her Charms the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of his liberty. You let your ſuſpitions fly too far at random, ſaid I, I am ſo ſenſible that <hi>Terentia</hi> is the Wife of <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> that I dare not be ſenſible of any Charm in her, inconſiſtent with that quality. The ſame reaſon, reply'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> which you oppoſe to your love of <hi>Terentia,</hi> would be the chiefeſt motive to induce me to attempt it. <hi>Mecoenas</hi> is a perſon worthy of Love, he married <hi>Terentia</hi> for Love, and he is moſt paſſionately enamour'd of her; And theſe, upon a juſt balance, are the true diſpoſitions, which a Man of Merit ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in a Miſtriſs; and methinks a temptation ſhould invade the ſacred <hi>Auguſtus</hi> himſelf, whoſe Soul is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:94435:75"/> ſo ſuſceptible of the impreſſions of Love, to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the pleaſures of unthroning a Subject of <hi>Mecoenas</hi> his Merit. Let us ſpeak of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſaid I, interrupting his bold diſcourſe, but with that veneration we ſpeak of the Gods, without all prophane appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. The inclinations we remark in him, agree ſo well with the characters of an heroick vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that we ought to reverence them in him, as ſome of its nobleſt Properties; but that which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in a Subject may paſs for a blameleſs acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in a Prince aſſumes another Character; and for the former to contain himſelf within the bounds of ſecurity, he ought not to ſuffer his Tongue to touch any action of his Sovereign, which it may prophane by an irreverence of expreſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ovid</hi> had too much apprehenſion to proſecute a diſcourſe any farther, which I had given ſuch a check to; and ſo for a while, we diverted it to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſubject, and ended our converſation for that day; but my thoughts remained ſo full of thoſe Idea's, his diſcourſe had imprinted in them, that it was impoſſible for me to baniſh them from thence. The great Merit of <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> which had ſerv'd till then for a Bridle to curb the exorbitancy of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, did now begin to ſpur them on, and indulge them a looſe Reine. I with impatience expected the hour, wherein I might ſee <hi>Terentia,</hi> and having by chance ſurpriz'd her, as ſhe was beſtowing ſome Careſſes upon her Husband, who left her, and was going forth, to wait upon your Majeſty; I grew ſo jealous, that I could not forbear to begin a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with her upon it.</p>
               <p>You do not conſider, with what you reproach me, ſaid ſhe, ſmiling upon me; A Woman is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94435:75"/> when ſhe is forc'd to counterfeit a Love, ſhe is not really ſenſible of; that for her own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, ſhe ought to ſtrain all the powers of her Soul, to ingraft that real ſenſibility in it. Why counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Love, Madam, ſaid I, wiſe Ladies exempt themſelves from that trouble, and confine the duty they owe their husbands, within the bounds of an honorable complaiſance. A complaiſance! ſaid <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia,</hi> what then without Love, and out of the ſole compliment of a pure complaiſance, muſt a Woman tranfact all the precious Minutes of her Life with a Man, receive his Careſſes, and—No, no, <hi>Agrippa,</hi> theſe thoughts diffuſe horror through all my veins; a Woman muſt either have a Love for her husband, or reſolve to ſacrifice the whole content of her life, to the tortures of a racking deſpair and inquietude. Theſe two extremes, Madam, ſaid I, may have a <hi>medium;</hi> a Wife places an eſteem upon that, in a husband, which may really challenge her eſteem: ſhe may allow him a Love too, if you will, ſuch as we attribute to the Merits of a faithful Friend: But as that kind of friendſhip does generally leave a <hi>vacuum</hi> in the heart, ſhe may make choice of a diſcreet and prudent Lover to fill it up, who balancing all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns betwixt her and her husband, may convert that ceremonious complaiſance, you made ſo ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an obſervation upon, into another <hi>ſpecies;</hi> and though different from Love, yet bearing as near a reſemblance to it, as it acts without conſtraint, or repugnance. Madam, I ſpeak of the heart only, ſaid I, ſeeing <hi>Terentia</hi> in ſome concern; and when one aſſigns that for the limit of his conceptions, he may without temerity allow them a large Field to expatiate in.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:94435:76"/>
               <p>The arrival of ſome Ladies interrupted our far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther converſe, but <hi>Terentia</hi> gave me to underſtand two dayes after in the Princeſs <hi>Julia</hi>'s apartment; that ſhe had revolv'd the effects of it in her curious thoughts. Some Perſons were pleas'd to think well of the endeavors I employ'd for the re-inſtating the Princeſs <hi>Scribonia</hi> in the good grace of the Empreſs. I told them, they deſerv'd as little praiſe, as they had coſt me trouble. A little counſel, which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs did me the honor to believe, was faithful and ſincere, had accompliſh'd that great work. Your counſels, ſaid <hi>Terentia,</hi> are of great force, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſeems to entail ſucceſs upon them. That ſame Heaven, Madam, I fear, reply'd I, fixing an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive regard upon her, would check my vanity, ſhould I preſume to entail a belief upon your curious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks. For is it poſſible, that my counſels are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the effects, you attribute to them? I know not, reply'd <hi>Terentia,</hi> if in all other things beſides, your endeavors may be ſo happy, as they have been in reconciling the Empreſs to <hi>Scribonia;</hi> but be it fortune, or deſign, I know by my own experience, that your counſels imprint a deep character in ſome hearts, that give ear to them.</p>
               <p>Who would not have believ'd, Sir, that theſe words were deſign'd to encourage my hopes? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd my ſelf, to digeſt them at liberty, into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> where I found <hi>Ovid,</hi> who ask'd me, if I had not encounter'd ſome Ladies in my walk. I had not ſeen any; and inſtead of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I ask'd him the reaſon of his queſtion; The reaſon is, ſaid he, becauſe I have juſt now found a Letter in the Cittron-Grove, which ſome Lady or other has drop'd; and in ſaying ſo he gave it me, where I read the following Lines:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94435:76"/>
                  <q>The more I combat my Enemy, the more I deſpair of Victory, my dear <hi>Tullia;</hi> The reflections, which ought to infuſe courage into my Soul, diſarm it of all reſolution; and if the arrival of ſome Ladies had not interrupted the converſe, which I had yeſterday with <hi>Agrippa,</hi> I bad reveal'd to him all the ſecrets of my heart. I muſt abandon it to its own inclination, which propoſes nothing to me but a glorious fall; but yet I hope to preſerve my ſelf ſo ſecure from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the real Precipice, that I ſhall need to fear no other reproaches, than thoſe which my virtue or loyalty ſhall raiſe againſt me; And if thoſe ſhould be ſeconded at laſt by a juſt remorſe, could that give me more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction or trouble, than the reſiſtance I have hitherto made with ſo much glory and fidelity?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Judge, Sir, I beſeech you, what the imaginations were, that invaded my thoughts, at the ſight of this Paper. I had oftentimes ſeen <hi>Terentia</hi>'s writing, and I believ'd it was her character. Are you, ſaid <hi>Ovid,</hi> who perceiv'd a diſturbance in my countenance, the Party, who ſuſtain the attacks of the combat, this Letter mentions? Or had it already ſucceeded to your glory? I know not, my dear <hi>Ovid,</hi> reply'd I; but the Party, who writ it, is the only Perſon in the Univerſe, I ever lov'd, or ever ſhall love. I do not ask you, who that Perſon is, ſaid <hi>Ovid</hi> with a ſmile, for I know you will name her to me without my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and not deprive a friend of ſo ſlight a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. I am endu'd with all the qualifications, requiſite in a real Confident; I am inur'd to all the moſt delicate intrigues of Love; I participate in the ſufferings of Lovers, and my brains are luxuriant in invention. Why do you therefore ſcruple to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:94435:77"/> me with the ſecret? I know not how to ſet an eſtimate upon my ſelf, and I expect you ſhould make it your requeſt to me, to lend my attention to the curioſity you have to impart to me.</p>
               <p>It is hard for a Lover, Sir, to wave the occaſion of diſcourſing of his Love: I diſcover'd to <hi>Ovid</hi> all the Cabinet-counſels of my heart. Your condition is more happy, ſaid he, than you apprehend it to be; <hi>Tullia</hi> entertains ſome good will for me; and ſince it appears by this Letter, ſhe is a Confident of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia</hi>'s, I dare promiſe you an aſſurance of a faithful intelligence. Let us firſt ſaid I, in order to the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence you mention, endeavor to diſcover who that fortunate Lover may be, in whoſe favor <hi>Terentia</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares herſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ovid</hi> would perſuade me, it was my ſelf; but I durſt not flatter my hopes with ſo erroneous a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. We recall'd to our thoughts each indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, perſon, that ſeem'd to affect a diligence or devotion to the ſervice of <hi>Mecoenas;</hi> and not being able to fix our judgments upon any one in particular, I referr'd the reſolution of our incertitude to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of <hi>Tullia.</hi> I conjur'd <hi>Ovid</hi> to give her a viſit the ſame day, and went my ſelf to give order for the Juſt, which about that time I caus'd to be ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd in memory of your Victories over the bloody Aſſaſſins of the great <hi>Julius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Victor was to receive the prize of the Courſe from the fair hand of <hi>Terentia,</hi> by the order of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coenas,</hi> by whom all occaſions of ſignalizing your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, were no leſs ambition'd, than by my ſelf: Never did his divine ſpoil charm the eyes of <hi>Rome</hi> with ſo dazling a luſtre. Divers Kings, and Sons of Kings, who aſſiſted at that Triumph, cry'd out aloud, That the ſole wonder of <hi>Rome,</hi> was the glorious Wife of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94435:77"/> 
                  <hi>Mecoenas.</hi> I had the honor to reconduct her back to her Apartment, charg'd with all the Tranſports of Love and Lovers Raptures, and at my coming forth, I met <hi>Ovid.</hi> Methought he endeavor'd to avoid me, and ſeem'd troubled at my encounter. How now? <hi>Ovid,</hi> what means this ſtrangeneſs, ſaid I, preſenting my ſelf to him. Have you any bad news, of which you fear to be the Author? Neither good, nor bad, anſwer'd he, but only that <hi>Tullia</hi> and my ſelf have had a ſmall quarrel; and I cannot wheedle the ſecret out of her, wherein you are concern'd. You have begun this quarrel very unſeaſonably, ſaid I; And if you had had any reſpect for me, you would have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd a Perſon with more prudence, on whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, you know, mine have ſo neceſſary a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. I muſt confeſs, I am in a fault, reply'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> and that was the reaſon, I was deſirous to ſhun you; but you now begin to have a ſenſible apprehenſion of Love, I have a moſt paſſionate one for the daughter of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and I ſuſpect her to be guilty of a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry towards me; and you cannot be ſo void of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment your ſelf, as not to comprehend, that ſuch a ſuſpition is able to deprive me of it.</p>
               <p>I was forc'd to take this excuſe for full payment, and content my ſelf with caſting ſome reproaches upon my deſtiny. But the next day after the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs gave a Ball, which was treated with a Noble Collation; where I perceiv'd that <hi>Ovid</hi> was not upon ſuch ill terms with <hi>Tullia,</hi> as he had perſuaded me. I diſcover'd them making Love to each other by private ſigns; <hi>Tullia</hi> paſſing by him, gave him a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret pinch on the arm; which <hi>Ovid</hi> obſerving I had taken notice of, took notice himſelf of the ſtolen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor; but in a Moment after, his ſubtlety gave place to his Love; for when <hi>Tullia</hi> came to take him out
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94435:78"/> to dance, he could not forbear, by a paſſionate geſture, to return her thanks for the honor of that obliging expreſſion of her kindneſs towards him.</p>
               <p>I could refrain no longer, then at the end of the Aſſembly, to exhibit unto him, the Indictment I had drawn up in my diſtracted thoughts, againſt his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I did not importune you for your aſſiſtance, ſaid I to <hi>Ovid;</hi> it was you your ſelf, who without my ſollicitation, made a voluntary offer of it to me. If you had had any private reaſon to repent your ſelf of ſo generous an action, you might with the ſame freedom have repeal'd it, and I would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd it back again to you, and not impos'd upon you a neceſſity, of offering me ſo unworthy an abuſe; but I fathom the Myſtery. You have taken your ſelf the advice, you not long ſince ſo frankly gave me, to love <hi>Terentia;</hi> Her charms have made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of your heart, and for that reaſon alone you have thought fit to make a friend of my integrity, the ſubject of your Perfidy. You do me a great deal of honor, reply'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> with a flattering kind of ſmile, to regard me with an eye of jealouſie; but yet as great as it is, it cannot ſeduce my vanity, I am in deſpair of ever meriting it; and for no other cauſe did I pretend a quarrel with <hi>Tullia,</hi> than that I might not be the Herald of ſuch unwelcom News, as I aſſur'd my ſelf that would be, which ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce to you an Emperor for your Rival. An Emperor? cry'd I, ſtarting back. Yes, ſaid <hi>Ovid,</hi> an Emperor; <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s greatneſs is inthron'd in the centre of <hi>Terentia</hi>'s heart; and you have not a Man for your Rival, who would ſacrifice his life at your feet, rather than diſpute that glory with you. But, <hi>Ovid,</hi> ſaid I, has <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ever expreſs'd any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94435:78"/> for the Wife of <hi>Mecoenas?</hi> All <hi>Rome</hi> is inform'd, he has fix'd them in another place. The Emperor, reply'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> owes only to his own Merit the Paſſion, he has given birth to; which he has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improv'd, nor cultivated yet by any particular addreſs; nay, he is wholly ignorant of its effects, and it is believ'd that <hi>Terentia</hi> herſelf would more than half die with confuſion, did ſhe ſuſpect, he were the leaſt ſenſible of them. See here what <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> writ to me the ſame day, you ſent me to employ her to gain the ſecret from <hi>Terentia.</hi> The Letter, which I found in the Gardens of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and you read, was loſt by <hi>Cicero</hi>'s daughter; and ſince this other, which you may here peruſe, I have had ſome converſe with her, who gave me a full account of all I have here repreſented to you; having ſaid this, he produc'd a Letter, of which the fragment that fell into your hands, Sir, was a part.</p>
               <p>Ye great Gods! What do you tell me? ſaid <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> Can I believe you? And can it be poſſible, that I made my ſelf the object of my own jealouſie? You may judge, Sir, reply'd <hi>Agrippa,</hi> by the ſequel of what I have to ſay, of the truth of my report. I could not acquieſce in the ſole teſtimony of <hi>Tullia;</hi> and as I endeavor'd to purchaſe a clearer evidence of my Misfortune, I am able to render your greatneſs a clearer aſſurance of your felicity.</p>
               <p>Revolve in your Royal imagination, I beſeech you, Sir, the deplorable condition, the diſcourſe of <hi>Ovid</hi> reduc'd me to: I conſider'd you as my Maſter, and glorious Patron, but ſtill as an envy'd Rival in my Miſtriſſes favor: And as under one of theſe forms you might with Juſtice command me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke my preſumptuous Love; under the other you baniſh'd out of my thoughts the Memory of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94435:79"/> and obligations I ow'd you, I darted a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand reproaches, a thouſand imprecations at my Stars, ten thouſand Murmurs againſt Heaven for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving form'd you ſo amiable: I do not fear to declare theſe extravagances to you, ſince I have now ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted them; and the more violent my tranſports were, the duty which triumph'd over them, will, I hope, merit a more favorable cenſure in your Auguſt thoughts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ovid</hi> would not leave me all that night; and though he were moſt ſenſibly touch'd with my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, yet he did combate them with ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, that it might be wiſh'd for the delight of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he had ſtill conſerv'd a due Reſpect and Memory of them. What do you think, ſaid he, to oppoſe againſt the Merit of your Emperor the coldneſs, which he yet entertains for the beauty of <hi>Terentia?</hi> Alas! do you imagine, that this coldneſs will be ſtill proof againſt that tender Paſſion, which <hi>Terentia</hi> will not be able long to diſguiſe under the Mask of ſo violent a Conſtraint? She is the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red beauty of the Empire, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> has a piercing judgment; ſhe cannot long remain expos'd to the deſtiny of loving by herſelf: And perhaps, at this very Moment, we are now diſcourſing, the cloud, which muſt of neceſſity be ſhortly tranſparent, may be remov'd from <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s eyes. He tells her the Univerſe has no fitter object for <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Love, than the immortal charms of the Divine <hi>Terentia:</hi> Then your deſigns, which hitherto may paſs only for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent attempts, will become unpardonable crimes. Be advis'd in time, and do not diſpute the title of <hi>Terentia</hi>'s Love, with the Maſter of the Univerſe, whoſe heart ought to be ſacred to you, ſince it is ſtamp'd with the image of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and the leaſt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94435:79"/> forfeit you ſhall make of that obedience you owe him, will be chaſtis'd as a criminal ingratitude in a perſon of <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s quality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ovid</hi> ſhew'd himſelf but too true a Prophet in his Predictions; you have been pleas'd to tell me ſince, that it was at that Juſt, where <hi>Terentia</hi> firſt began to charm you: but as I was ignorant of any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and my wound too new, to receive a cure from the hand of reaſon, I had no regard to his too real Divinations.</p>
               <p>I tormented my ſelf all night with ſuch reſtleſs diſtractions, and being inform'd the next day, by ſome Spies, which I alwayes maintain'd about <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia,</hi> that ſhe was to go to the Temple, you gave me leave to dedicate unto <hi>Neptune,</hi> I poſted thither with an impatient ſpeed. The Sacrifice was not begun, and whil'ſt it was preparing, <hi>Terentia</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted herſelf by a walk under the Trees, which in many pleaſant Groves are rank'd about that Fane.</p>
               <p>You need not ask, ſaid ſhe, as ſoon as ſhe ſaw me, what kind of devotion has invited <hi>Agrippa</hi> hither; he knew that <hi>Caeſar</hi> is preparing for his Voyage into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and is come to offer Sacrifice to the God of the <hi>Caerulean</hi> Empire, to purchaſe calm weather for his own Emperor. And, Madam, ſaid I, are you come to purchaſe Storms and Tempeſts! I am too good a <hi>Roman,</hi> reply'd ſhe with a ſurprizing bluſh, to offer up to the Gods ſuch ſacrilegious Vows. And too clear-ſighted, Madam, ſaid I, to regard the glory of <hi>Caeſar</hi> with ah eye of that indifferency, as perhaps ſome other good <hi>Romans</hi> do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Terentia</hi> was ſo diſcompos'd with this little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, that it was a long time before ſhe could frame an Anſwer; but at length recompoſing her
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94435:80"/> ſelf, you have attack'd me more than once, reply'd ſhe, with ſuch myſterious diſcourſes: your Advice againſt what I owe to <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> your flattering cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and your diligence, cauſe me to ſuſpect, ſome private end is the Mark, they are level'd at. You now make your reflections upon <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and may it not be poſſible, that great <hi>Caeſar</hi> may honor with a generous compaſſion the innocent inclinations of his humble Handmaid?</p>
               <p>I was now ſo diſorder'd my ſelf at this queſtion, that for a quarter of an hour, I loſt the total uſe of my tongue, when <hi>Terentia</hi> with a ſerious look ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a deſcant upon the diſtraction, ſhe ſaw me in, you are ſurpriz'd, I ſee, ſaid ſhe, to hear me propoſe, ſo unexpected a Problem to you. And perhaps you will ſay, that my late Manner of converſing with you, has not prepar'd you to entertain it: But <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi> the Paſſion I have for <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> has ſomething in it of ſo noble and ſo pure, that I can own it without the reproach of a guilty bluſh: And I ſhall confeſs that my heart receiv'd the image of <hi>Caeſar</hi> from my tender years, that this impreſſion has grown with me, and that the Emperor has no engagements ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in War, or Love, wherein it does not challenge a private concern. And does he entertain the like for me? Speak, and do not keep my Soul any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in ſuſpence; The purity of my intentions ought to leave no impure ſuſpitions in yours. I love <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> as we love the Gods; and I ſhould believe, I ſhould be guilty of an impiety againſt them, ſhould I love him otherwayes. Speak, <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and give me a clear explanation of that which the muteneſs of your tongue, and the eloquence of your eyes, gives me ſome apprehenſions of. Oh! Madam, cry'd I, my eyes and my tongue are but the too fatal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of my thoughts.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:94435:80"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Terentia</hi> did without doubt penetrate the ſenſe of this Exclamation; ſhe bluſh'd, and pretending the Sacrifice was ready to begin, ſhe took the occaſion, and enter'd briskly into the Temple, leaving me without the power to follow her. I had diſcover'd in her eyes, a kind of, I know not what deſpite; mix'd with a reſervedneſs and diſdain, which I was no longer able to ſupport. I went home to my houſe, where I found your Orders to ſummon me to your preſence; With a feeble and languiſhing motion I paid obedience to your commands, and I thought that day would have put a mortal period to the cauſe of it; for, Sir, you commanded my attendance for no other, than to confide to me the ſecret of your new Amour.</p>
               <p>I did not render my ſelf guilty of a treaſonable Crime in oppoſing it, but I told you at the ſame time, that I was deceiv'd, if <hi>Terentia</hi> did not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it with all the concerns of a reciprocal Paſſion: But this conſtraint was ſo repugnant to my nature, that it ever apprehended with horror the neceſſity of often renewing it. A little after I made my Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition into <hi>Sicily,</hi> on which the contemplative Judges of other Mens Actions took the liberty to ſpend their verdicts at their pleaſure; And I am return'd, thanks to the great Gods, ſo perfectly cur'd of my folly, that I hope they will inſpire more dutiful prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples into me, than to diſpute the Juſtice or Merits of my Cauſe, with my glorious Emperor.</p>
               <p>I had ſeveral times reſolv'd to declare to you the ſecret Crime, my Love tempted me to commit againſt you; but as that declaration would have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerv'd to have aſſur'd you of your felicity, (and that I found you had an undoubted aſſurance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) I judg'd it unneceſſary. My Crime, Sir, is

Judge now, Sir, I beſeech you, if your reaſon tells you, you have done <hi>Terentia</hi> juſtice, in ſuſpecting her of infidelity.</p>
               <p>The Emperor attributed an entire confidence to the Relation of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> which perfectly reconcil'd his jealouſie to his doubts concerning the Paper, which had come to his hand; but there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no leſs important, ſtill inherent in his inquiet imagination. The diſcovery of a new Rival ever begets a new trouble in our fancy; and though in the height of its capriciouſneſs he exhal'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, when ſuited only with the reſentments of a Lover abus'd, yet he was not aſſur'd if he had not, ſince the firſt birth of his jealouſie, ſome juſt grounds to harbor a contrary belief. He imparted all his thoughts to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who endeavor'd to calm them, with the beſt arguments he was capable of, he had made a moſt diligent inſpection into all the concerns of <hi>Terentia,</hi> from the firſt Minute he had entertain'd any for her himſelf; And the love of <hi>Craſſus</hi> had not deluded it, and therefore he conjur'd <hi>Caeſar</hi> to believe, that he had purchas'd no other advantage with all his aſſiduities, than a diſdainful repulſe of his rejected ſuit. The Emperor, whoſe Love, was as unquiet, as paſſionate, and deſired only to find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, was willing, to be convinc'd by the reaſonings of <hi>Agrippa:</hi> and teſtify'd no leſs acknowledgments to him, for this conqueſt he had made of his jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, than he had done before, when by thoſe he had made of his moſt redoubted Enemies, he had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd him in the Imperial Throne of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe:
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94435:82"/> And haſtening to the Apartment of <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> he was inflam'd with impatience, till he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his unjuſt ſuſpicions to beg a ſubmiſſive pardon of her injur'd Loyalty; but he was diſappointed of his deſign, for ſhe was gone to viſit <hi>Tullia,</hi> at her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate <hi>Villa,</hi> which her Father <hi>Cicero</hi> had left her near <hi>Tuſeulum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When theſe two Confidents ſaw themſelves in a, capacity of enjoying each others converſation with freedom, <hi>Terentia</hi> declar'd to <hi>Tullia</hi> the diſgrace of <hi>Craſſus;</hi> and that ſhe was inform'd by ſome perſons, whom ſhe privately entertain'd near the Emperor, that he had utter'd ſome expreſſions before them, which his jealouſie ſeem'd to have forc'd from him. You know, ſaid ſhe, whether this jealouſie has any ſolid ground, or no to ſupport it ſelf; and whether I am not able to apply an infallible remedy to his imaginary diſtemper, but he will not vouchſafe to have recourſe to it. He caus'd <hi>Craſſus</hi> to be arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he commanded all his Papers to be brought to him, and examin'd them, without imparting to me the leaſt inkling of his deſigns. What could he have done more, had I been convicted of a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal compliance? Oh! how unjuſt are Men? The moſt accompliſh'd among them become either In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grates, or Tyrants, as ſoon as they imagine they have gain'd the leaſt intereſt in our affections, you do not conſider, ſaid <hi>Tullia,</hi> interrupting her, at what Mark you level your complaints. Jealouſie is the infallible Herald of a violent Paſſion, and I ſhould have had a greater for <hi>Ovid,</hi> than I now have, if when I put his to the teſt, I had found it of the ſame temper with <hi>Caeſars.</hi> I muſt confeſs, reply'd <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> that a little jealouſie is inſeparable from a great love; but do you underſtand, with what kind of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:94435:83"/> jealouſie I would have <hi>Auguſtus</hi> poſſeſt? I would have him jealous of his own Imperial Grandeur; that he ſhould fear, leſt that ſhould have a more powerful influence upon my inclinations, than the Merits of his Perſon; and that being exagitated without intermiſſion by that active ſuſpicion, he ſhould employ the greatneſs it ſelf, as an humble Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to me, to lend him my aſſiſtance to deſtroy it: yet all this ſhould not make me forget the reſpect I owe to the grandeur of his Soul, and the illuſtrious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his generoſity; but elevating my own Meanneſs to meet his Greatneſs at the point, to which he ſhould be pleas'd to debaſe himſelf be low his own ſphere, we would form a concurrence of ſpiritual deſires, that ſhould prevent the Lethargy of long and languiſhing Paſſions. But alas! it is not this noble kind of jealouſie, but a ſordid and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one, which <hi>Caeſar</hi> is guilty of, and with which he has already alarum'd the ears of the World, without vouchſafing to think mine worthy to receive from him the leaſt whiſper of it, and believing me to be light, ingrateful, treacherous— He believes you to be no ſuch thing, reply'd the daughter of <hi>Cicero,</hi> interrupting her, he only fears leſt the Merit; or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduities of a new Lover ſhould make a breach in your heart; and as it is to that heart only, to which he has confin'd his pretenſions, the leaſt impreſſion, any other ſhould make there, he interprets, as an uſurpation upon his own Prerogative. If you had not limited your favors to ſo narrow a circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> would have thought himſelf more ſecure. There are certain Marks and Pledges of Love, after which a Lover cannot ſuſpect his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs of unconſtancy, without committing a mortal offence againſt her: But the gift of the heart, is not
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:94435:83"/> of that number; there is no particular value to be ſet upon it, but in the fancy of the Lover only, who thinks himſelf poſſeſs'd of it; and as a Woman is ſeldom tempted more than once, to make a free do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thereof, and ſeldom wants the temptation of often violating it, ſhe leaves alwayes an apprehenſion in a ſenſible Lover, leſt ſhe ſhould be mov'd by ſome powerful Motive, to embrace the latter, as being moſt obvious. Oh! <hi>Tullia,</hi> cry'd the Wife of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coenas,</hi> I could be angry to ſee you frame ſuch groſs conceits on ſo delicate a Subject; the gift of the heart is ſo far from leaving any juſt ſcruple in the Souls of thoſe that love, that it is only capable to aſſure their repoſe. All Pledges of Love, which are not included within it, are the effects of a weakneſs, which I think none ought to be guilty of, if they can avoid it, and that one may be guilty of more than once, ſince it is not voluntary and unconſtrain'd. But that Love, whereof all the Paſſions acknowledge the Empire of reaſon, has I know not what in it of ſo noble, and ſo pure, that it will not admit the allay of any baſe or ignoble thought, and would make a greater ſcruple of the leaſt infidelity, than your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine Ladies do of the greateſt Crimes.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Terentia</hi> had with theſe laſt words concluded her delicate diſtinctions, a Servant came and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd <hi>Tullia,</hi> that <hi>Varentilla</hi> and <hi>Fulvia,</hi> attended by <hi>Horace, Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Gallus,</hi> the Praetor of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were come from <hi>Rome</hi> to wait on her. <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> was come thither to entertain her unquiet thoughts with that pleaſant ſolitude, and was not then in a fit humor for a general converſe. But the Train was compos'd of too many illuſtrious Perſons, not to be receiv'd with all the demonſtrations of an obliging reſpect and welcom. <hi>Fulvia</hi> was daughter
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94435:84"/> to that renowned Tutor of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> whoſe glories with himſelf were buried in the common ruines of the bloody Triumvirate: And the Emperor deſirous to repair in her the Misfortunes of her Father, made but little difference in appearance betwixt her, and the Princeſs his daughter. <hi>Varentilla</hi> was her Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, and had married the Head of the <hi>Claudian</hi> Family, which has ſince given <hi>Caeſars</hi> to the Empire; and it is thought, that ſhe preceded <hi>Terentia</hi> in the heart of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> The two Friends went forth of their flowry Cabinet, where their converſe was, and advanced to give a reception to the noble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>They found them in a Baſſe-Gallery, which open'd with a ſtately Portal, and was wainſcoted with cedar, and hung round with divers rich pieces, repreſenting the moſt Memorable Actions of her Fathers life. His famous pleading for <hi>Roſcius,</hi> which oblig'd him to flie into <hi>Greece,</hi> to ſubſtract himſelf from the fury of <hi>Sylla;</hi> the applauſes and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, he receiv'd at <hi>Athens;</hi> his triumphant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into his own Countrey, and his honor for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it from the bloody attempts of <hi>Cataline:</hi> His journey towards <hi>Pompey,</hi> and that barbarous death he ſuſtained, which branded with an eternal ignominy the Poſterity of thoſe that inflicted it.</p>
               <p>Had the Painter, ſaid <hi>Virgil,</hi> upon the ſurvey of thoſe pieces, conſulted my Memoires, he had not omitted the adventure of <hi>Milo.</hi> I caus'd it not to be here inſerted, reply'd <hi>Tullia,</hi> becauſe I have heard ſome reports, that in that encounter, the artifice of <hi>Hortenſius</hi> triumph'd over the eloquence of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is a Fiction, ſaid <hi>Virgil,</hi> he did not gain that cauſe, though he gain'd no ſmall honor by it; you were not in the World, when it was a witneſs
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94435:84"/> to that grand tryal; and therefore you are ignorant doubtleſs, of the circumſtances of it; which I ſhall give you a faithful account of, when you pleaſe to command it; and by it convince you, that your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Father, never did any thing more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and glorious.</p>
               <p>The time was never unſeaſonable to lend atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what <hi>Virgil</hi> had to ſay. <hi>Terentia,</hi> with an obliging expoſtulation, complain'd of his unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for deſigning to reſerve that Relation for <hi>Tullia</hi> only. And <hi>Virgil,</hi> who underſtood very well the extent of that complaiſance, we ought to exhibit to our Sovereigns in the perſon of thoſe, they have an eſteem for, told her ſhe might command what ſhe pleas'd, and he was ready to obey. The Company mov'd towards a Walk, which repreſented a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Arbor, or green <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrella,</hi> under which in the moſt ſcorching heats of Summer, you could not be incommoded by the Sun. <hi>Virgil</hi> plac'd himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the four Ladies: And <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> guarded the end of each Wing, and ſo marching all a-breaſt, <hi>Virgil</hi> began his recital in this manner.</p>

               <head>A <hi>MEMORABLE ACT</hi> OF Cicero.</head>
               <p>IT is not ſo long, ſince the famous <hi>Cicero</hi> dy'd, but that his glorious Memory may be yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to the thoughts, and almoſt the eyes, of the perſons, that honor me with their attention. Few are ignorant, I ſuppoſe, how <hi>Claudius</hi> having been ſurpriz'd in a female diſguiſe in the Palace of the great <hi>Julius, Cicero</hi> publickly cenſur'd this licentious Audacity; and that <hi>Claudius</hi> being ſince elected Conſul, omitted no occaſion to exerciſe a Mortal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon him for this Affront. He perſecuted him both in his eſtate and reputation, forc'd him to turn Exile, and flie to <hi>Dirachium,</hi> and had perhaps made his Fury the bloody Executioner of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, had not <hi>Milo</hi> put a period to his rage, by putting one to his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Milo</hi> had committed this Homicide in the juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his own Life, and the Laws of all Nations, pleaded a Pardon for him; and to ſupport the juſtice of his Cauſe, he had made it a Client to <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero.</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:94435:85"/> At that time there was in <hi>Rome</hi> a fair <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> celebrated there under the name of <hi>Plautia,</hi> to whom the Orator <hi>Hortenſius</hi> dedicated both his love and eloquence; and who by the excellence of her wit, and a thouſand other admirable qualities and charms, had purchas'd the Fame of a matchleſs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy in her Sex.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hortenſius</hi> told her, for a piece of pleaſing News, that he was choſen to ſuſtain the Accuſation againſt <hi>Milo.</hi> Do you not tremble, ſaid <hi>Plautia</hi> to him, at the thoughts of encountring an eloquence, which has ſo often been victorious? It is not the firſt time, reply'd <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> that I have enter'd the Liſts againſt it. There are few cauſes of note, which are not divided betwixt <hi>Cicero</hi> and my ſelf; I plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him for <hi>Antony,</hi> for <hi>Aſinius-Pollio,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others. We were Antagoniſts in the Tryals of <hi>Lucius-Murena,</hi> and if I may without the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vanity, repeat what <hi>Rome</hi> herſelf has pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, it was not <hi>Cicero,</hi> whom her loud acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proclaim'd the Victor. That was, reply'd <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> becauſe in thoſe encounters, you did not plead for the condemnation of the Murderer of <hi>Claudius. Cicero</hi> will paramount himſelf, and think it a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme glory, to wreſt out of the hands of Juſtice ſo notorious a Criminal; and if you will be advis'd by a Friend, wave, if you can, ſo hazardous an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</p>
               <p>I neither can, nor ought to wave it, reply'd <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius;</hi> I am choſen to demand ſatisfaction for the blood of <hi>Claudius,</hi> I ſhould betray it if I ſhould be ſilent; and beſides, our profeſſion has that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over all others, that it may gain reputation, but loſe none, though it loſe a cauſe. If I ſhould ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the eloquence of <hi>Cicero,</hi> I ſhould purchaſe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:94435:86"/> immortal honor; and ſhould mine receive a foile from his, it would receive no blemiſh in the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw; our ardor and zeal ſupply the place of a proſperous ſucceſs, and never Orator yet was charg'd with the partiality or petulancy of a biaſſed Judge. I am not of that opinion, reply'd <hi>Plautia,</hi> there are ſome qualities, which a perſon of honeſt principles ought to dedicate his whole life to the acquiſition of; the labour they coſt, ought not to deter us from the purſuit of them; and it is more glorious to miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in that, than to think we can live with honor without them. But Eloquence is not of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament, which has no motives to compel us to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict our ſelves to its profeſſion. It neither inſpires us with honeſty, nor equitable thoughts, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy or reſolution in Adverſities; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it may corrupt and vitiate the candid temper of an ingenuous Soul. For an Orator does often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make it his ſport and recreation to patronize an unjuſt cauſe, and hopes he may eaſily perſuade others to believe, what he ſeems to believe himſelf. It is therefore nothing, but the choice of the Will; and when it turns to the confuſion of him that made it, it leaves him convinc'd of his own ignorance, the baſeneſs of his ſpirit, and the weakneſs of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Theſe words, pronounc'd by a perſon <hi>Hortenſius</hi> moſt ardently affected, made ſo ſtrong an impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his thoughts, that leaving <hi>Plautia,</hi> he went in haſte to find out <hi>Cicero.</hi> You are a Perſon of too honorable Principles, ſaid he to him, not to approve of the preference of Juſtice, before all the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges one might hope to obtain by force of a vigorous Eloquence. And it is a glorious one for me, to be thought worthy of the honor of arguing an opinion
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:94435:86"/> againſt you: If mine ſhould be convincing, what immortal Laurels would Fame plant upon my Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? And ſhould you refute it, I ſhould learn by my defeat, to aſſure my ſelf of Victory in other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters with the ſame arms which gave it me. But <hi>Cicero,</hi> the advantageous ſucceſs wherewith you ſee, I might flatter my thoughts, ought not to efface out of them that juſt remorſe, which would certainly attend it. <hi>Claudius</hi> was a vicious Man, and <hi>Milo</hi> has oblig'd all good Men, by freeing <hi>Rome</hi> from ſo corrupt a Member, by an action he was forc'd to commit in the juſt defence of his life. I will not plead for his condemnation; and either the error or partiality of the Judges, may, perhaps, over-rule the force of your reaſons: I would not have you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expoſe <hi>Milo</hi> to that danger; he ſtands juſtify'd already in my thoughts, and I ſhall be ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that on the examination of the Fact, Juſtice oblig'd me to pronounce him innocent.</p>
               <p>The Enemies of <hi>Cicero</hi> pretend, that an itch of Ambition would not ſuffer him to embrace this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. He had already made ſome laborious reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Cauſe, and aſſur'd himſelf of a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſucceſs; and would not, ſay they, loſe neither his labour, nor the fruits he expected to reap from it. But I know, that was not the Motive; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, that he might be accus'd of ſome juggle, or underhand dealing, if in the face of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, where the Murderer of <hi>Claudius</hi> was brought to a publick Tryal, the Advocate for the dead Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhould obſerve a wilful and ſuſpected ſilence; and therefore he was reſolv'd to plead; and <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> who fear'd the reproaches of <hi>Plautia,</hi> and ſaw himſelf ſupported by the credit of <hi>Cato,</hi> to whom the dead Perſon was Nephew, us'd ſo much artifice,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94435:87"/> that, as <hi>Tullia</hi> expreſt it, he triumph'd that day over the Eloquence of <hi>Cicero.</hi> He caus'd falſe informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be given to the Senate, which oblig'd them to ſend ſome armed Bands to keep the People within the bounds of their duty: Theſe Soldiers being gain'd by <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> did by their inſolencies ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb and interrupt <hi>Cicero</hi> in the moſt material parts of the cauſe, that <hi>Milo</hi> was not only condemn'd to baniſhment, and a ſevere mulct ſet upon his head, but likewiſe expos'd to an eminent danger of his life.</p>
               <p>I made my return juſt about that time from <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> where the generous bounty of the illuſtrious <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coenas</hi> had grac'd me with a conſiderable Employ. The reputation of <hi>Cicero</hi> was not unknown to me, I had an ardent ambition to have the honor of being inroll'd in the number of his Friends, and <hi>Manlius</hi> preſented me to him the very ſame day, wherein he had loſt his cauſe for <hi>Milo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence come you? ſaid he to me, as ſoon as he underſtood who I was; Go build your ſelf a Cabin upon the ruines of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and turn Heardſman there to ſome wealthy Graſier, if you want ability to keep one your ſelf; and bury your glory in the ſmoaking ruines of your Countrey, rather than breathe the corrupted Air of this pernicious City; which triumphs now in nothing, but treachery and injuſtice. The Senate, that once renowned Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, now tamely receives its decrees from the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Supreme Authority, wherewith it oppreſſes the innocent, and juſtifies the guilty: Flie, flie, wiſe ſtranger, from a Climate ſo barbarous and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manlius</hi> had heard what had arriv'd to him; what? <hi>Cicero,</hi> ſaid he, does your animoſity againſt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94435:87"/> 
                  <hi>Claudius,</hi> ſurvive the date of his life? And do you imprecate <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe an unexpected revenge has honourably entomb'd his aſhes in the Urn? It is not <hi>Claudius,</hi> when I now conſider, reply'd <hi>Cicero;</hi> for had he been the deareſt of my friends, the revenge of his death notwithſtanding would never have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to me the leſs unjuſt.</p>
               <p>Then he briefly ſummon'd up to us the Points upon which the juſtification of <hi>Milo</hi> ought to have been eſtabliſh'd, and how <hi>Hortenſius</hi> himſelf made a ſcruple to ſuſtain the Accuſation againſt him: What! ſaid <hi>Cicero,</hi> the Accuſer of the pretended Criminal declares him innocent, and ſhall the authority of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> have the power to pronounce him Guilty? <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> could not find amongſt all the querks and jingles of his profeſſion, a pretence ſufficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the death of <hi>Claudius</hi> puniſhable: And becauſe he was Nephew to <hi>Cato,</hi> the Senate denounces it ſelf the mortal Enemy of his Murderer? Ha! my dear <hi>Manlius,</hi> what Age do we live in? I have juſt now ſent <hi>Milo</hi> a Sum to diſcharge the weight of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Fine: which honor obliges me to pay, ſince he owes his condemnation to the ſole ambition I had to expoſe the equity of his cauſe to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world. Had I been ſilent, he had been free; and the ardor, I expreſs'd, to vindicate his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, has condemn'd it. I will retire to ſome Deſart, to expiate amongſt dumb Animals, the crime of my Loquacity; and <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall no more behold me in her Pulpits, till ſhe become again what ſhe was in the dayes of our Fathers, which is as much as to ſay, ſhe ſhall never behold me more. Our Vices have exaſperated Heaven; it has averted from us theſe benign influences, which formerly render'd us vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, juſt and ſincere; deſolate <hi>Rome</hi> draws near
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94435:88"/> her ruine, ſince the Gods permit her to draw upon her crimes their indignation; and I ſhall ſpeedily prepare an Elegy to deplore her <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> with more reaſon, than <hi>Virgil</hi> has at this day to deplore the deſolation of his <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manlius</hi> combated, with all the Arguments he could frame, this obſtinate reſolution of his Friend; and though I was not ſo well known to him, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the preſumption of giving him counſel, yet I could not forbear to uſe theſe expreſſions; Sir, ſaid I, the more vicious you judge <hi>Rome,</hi> the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon you have to make your ſelf a Preſident not to abandon her. What will become of her, if all the brave and honeſt <hi>Romans</hi> you are acquainted with, ſhould put on the ſame reſolutions as you do, to proſcribe themſelves from their Countrey, and leave her a prey to ſo many devouring Monſters? It is the duty of the vertuous, to protect her, when publick Vices attack her; and you muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt to the Gods for the impunity, to which your abſence ſhall expoſe the crime of Libertines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> was pleas'd to accept in good part my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, and honor them too with expreſſions they could not merit. But beſides, that he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably fix'd to his reſolutions, he had ſo much incommoded himſelf by the liberal disburſment he had made for <hi>Milo,</hi> that he had reduc'd his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a neceſſity of ſpending ſome time in a Country retirement. He withdrew to this place, which was not then what his own induſtry, and the curioſity of his worthy daughter have render'd it ſince. Alas! I had cauſe to oppoſe my moſt powerful reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this retreat, which has coſt me ſo many ſighs, and melancholy hours; and my divining Soul ſeem'd before-hand, to give me an ill-reliſhing taſte of the various misfortunes it prepar'd for me.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:94435:88"/>
               <p>Theſe laſt words of <hi>Virgil</hi> inflam'd the curioſity and attention of thoſe that heard him, which would have oblig'd him to a ſecond Relation, had they not ſeen appear at the end of the Walk, the Emperor, the Princeſs <hi>Julia,</hi> the Prince <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious <hi>Agrippa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tullia</hi> haſten'd to preſent her ſelf unto them; and wholly ſurpriz'd with that unexpected honor, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd her acknowledgments by a confuſion in her countenance, which expreſs'd as much eloquence, as one of her Fathers moſt ſtudied Orations could have done. The Emperor was naturally affable and courteous, and had his thoughts been leſs perplex'd and incumber'd, would, in obliging terms, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliated that obliging Air of ſatisfaction and joy, which <hi>Tullia</hi> expreſs'd in his reception. But they were wholly fix'd upon the Wife of <hi>Mecoenas;</hi> when diſcovering her at the farther end of the Walk, who partly out of ſurprize, and partly diſdain, had not advanc'd to receive him, he left <hi>Julia</hi> with the Daughter of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and like a complaiſant Lover, mov'd his condeſcending Greatneſs towards her. The Air of the Campagne, Madam, ſaid he, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching her, has already, methinks, render'd you ſingular, you take no delight to follow the company; and had I follow'd your example, I had this day in vain left <hi>Rome,</hi> to purchaſe yours. I know, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and diſtance I owe my Emperor, reply'd <hi>Terentia</hi> coldly; and I ſhall not aſſume the confidence to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him, without his ſpecial command. Ha! Madam, ſaid <hi>Caeſar,</hi> interrupting her, it is not ſuch a cold reſpect you owe him, but one of a little more love, and a little more ſincerity. Forget he is Maſter of the Univerſe, but remember that he has given you his whole heart, that you owe him all yours; and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94435:89"/> that you cannot acquit your ſelf of your obligations towards him, as long as you entertain the addreſſes of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and encourage them by conſtituting him the Guardian of your choiceſt ſecrets. I never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd the addreſſes of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> reply'd <hi>Terentia,</hi> but as an office of friendſhip, whereof your bounteous favors for <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> and my ſelf, have given Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to the whole Empire; and if they are level'd at any other mark, I ſcorn to give them entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my thoughts. You are the moſt ſpiritual of all Women, Madam, reply'd the Emperor; and it is not hard for you to captivate as well the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as you have done the heart, of a Prince, over whom you reign as Sovereign Empreſs. But, Madam, ſaid he, (ſhewing her the Verſes he had taken from <hi>Craſſus</hi>) were theſe confecrated to you without your knowledge? and if you accepted the Sacrifice, could you without a crime flatter the auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fancy of a Rival to <hi>Caeſar?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Terentia</hi> was ſurpriz'd at the view of theſe effects of <hi>Craſſus</hi>'s love: ſhe thought it had not been ſo durable, as to cauſe him to make ſuch paſſionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections. I know not, ſaid ſhe, whither theſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were compos'd for me, I never ſaw them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and I really believe, ſome other Perſon to be the Subject of them. But, Sir, though it were true, that a young inconſiderate Perſon ſhould be guilty of the folly of entertaining a Paſſion for me, could <hi>Caeſar</hi> fear a Rival of ſo ſmall conſideration? Upon what grounds, Sir, do you raiſe your apprehenſions? Upon the preference, the Merits of <hi>Craſſus</hi> may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge over <hi>Caeſars?</hi> Upon the propenſity, you have found in me, to violate either my word, or my duty? Upon my natural levity, or the character of my amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inclinations? Oh! Sir, can you know me, can
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94435:89"/> you eſteem me, and yet be capable of ſuch injurious ſuſpitions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> was willing to be convinc'd of his error, and haſtily gave credit to all, <hi>Terentia</hi> was pleas'd to have him believe: and whil'ſt he was pleading a Pardon for the injuſtice he had committed againſt her innocence, in framing an unworthy ſuſpicion of it, <hi>Agrippa</hi> was retir'd into the ſame Grove, where a little before <hi>Terentia</hi> and <hi>Tullia</hi> had entertain'd their private converſe. There he broke open a Letter, which was deliver'd him upon the Road, and he knew to come from <hi>Ovid. Horace,</hi> who had follow'd him, found him reading the Contents of it, which advis'd him to an action which he had often had a deſign to execute.</p>
               <p>A Man may know that <hi>Tullia</hi> is taken up with ſome extraordinary affairs, ſaid he to <hi>Horace;</hi> if you could have commanded the freedom of her conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, you would not have done me the honor, at this preſent, to have ſought after any other. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend you, reply'd <hi>Horace;</hi> you railly me upon my libertine humor; and you ingeniouſly reproach me, that Love is not the Divinity I ſacrifice to. A Perſon, reply'd <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who ſhould only become acquainted with you by the voice of publick Error, would be apt, perhaps, to caſt that reproach upon you; but an intimate Friend to <hi>Ovid,</hi> knows how to give you your due character. I am not ignorant of any of your Triumphs, and I can teſtifie, that you are not leſs favor'd by Love, than any other of the Diety. <hi>Ovid</hi> is a great Maſter in the Art of Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſing, reply'd <hi>Horace</hi> with a ſmile, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he took me for the River <hi>Alpheus,</hi> or the Nymph <hi>Salmacis,</hi> when he character'd me for an Amoriſt. He took you, ſaid <hi>Agrippa,</hi> for his dangerous Rival, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94435:90"/> he has found ſo few that merit that title, that he could not confound them in ſumming them up. I know you have ſtolen from him the heart of <hi>Tullia,</hi> and that ſhe being ſeduc'd by the gayety of your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, has made the charming <hi>Ovid</hi> underſtand, that he was not born to be alwayes the firſt to diſſolve the bands of an amorous intrigue. You relate to me a pleaſant Fable, Sir, reply'd <hi>Horace;</hi> and you doubtleſs forget, that it is a famous Debauche, who has the honor to talk to you. To puniſh you for your diſſimulation, ſaid <hi>Agrippa,</hi> making him ſit down by him, you ſhall recount to me without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, or delay, the particulars of your Amour, which I was never perfectly inform'd of by <hi>Ovid;</hi> who, I obſerv'd, could never diſcourſe of it without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and therefore I was willing to indulge his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that ſatisfaction, as not to preſs him to ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing a recital: But ſince I know, you are able to ſurmount all troubles incident to tender Lovers, I ſhall not obſerve that Punctilio with you. I know upon what occaſion the Emperor is come hither, and we may have the liberty of diſcourſing above an hour without interruption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s Merits might ſo juſtly challenge the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the whole Empire, and <hi>Horace</hi> ſtood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to them for ſo many favors, that it would have been a piece of rude ingratitude in him, to have oppos'd the leaſt delay to his deſires. He told him by way of a gallantry, that he was ſo inur'd to Victory, that he conquer'd all he attack'd; and by the command of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> keeping the Seat he had plac'd him in, he began in this manner.</p>

               <head>THE HISTORY OF Horace.</head>
               <p>THE World has incurr'd an error in judgment, my Lord, in that it has made of me; which believes that good cheer is the ſole Deity I idolize: who have neither guſt, nor deſires, but to delicious Novels; and only regard Love, as an intermeſs, or preparative to quicken their appetite for the better reliſhing voluptuous varieties of a luxurious Table. This draught does nothing at all reſemble me. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is that I ſeek at Feaſts, more than the delicacies of their entertainments; and if a Man in the whole courſe of his life were endu'd with a Soul ſo brutiſh, that it were capable of no other inclinations, than what a gourmandizing appetite ſhould inſpire into it, I ſhould be found oftner at the private Tables of my Friends, than in their Halls at their publick Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets.</p>
               <p>Theſe practices may divert a Mans thoughts from more ſerious Reflections, or Employs, but cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94435:91"/> them of all propenſity to generous actions, or noble and tender Paſſions: And his reaſon is the more refin'd by them, ſince he does not aſſociate himſelf with his Friends, but to make a more open profeſſion of it: And a Man is ſo far from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe Vices, which infect his nature with bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by this frank overture, that a Man is really more a Man, when his Soul is totally unmask'd of that diſſimulation, which is generally practis'd by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a more reſerv'd converſe.</p>
               <p>I had made ſome remarks upon theſe diſtinctions in an Ode I compos'd in the praiſe of a magnificent Banquet, made by the generous <hi>Mecoenas;</hi> and this Poem was receiv'd with ſo much applauſe, that a Critick ought to have been very audacious, that durſt have cenſur'd it. <hi>Ovid</hi> glory'd to be that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious One; and being one day in the preſence of the Princeſs <hi>Julia,</hi> he omitted no kind of Raillery wherewith he did not play upon me, for dedicating my <hi>genius</hi> wholly to <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> Revels and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs.</p>
               <p>What do you find in it ſo ridiculous, ſaid I to him? Is not the fertile Vine, which is Mother to the delicious <hi>Falernian</hi> Grape, as worthy of the nobleſt Idea's of a Poet, as the Flowers, you combine into an odoriferous Poſie, and therein preſent us with a <hi>Clita,</hi> or an <hi>Hippolita?</hi> This Allegory, reply'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> has relation to a paſſion of the Soul, much nobler than that of a gluttonous appetite; and it is more glorious for a Poet to teach Lovers the gentile Art of Loving, than Debauchees, the moſt ingenious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of improving their Debaucheries. Love, ſaid I, ſurprizes the frolick ſpirit amidſt the jollity of his Cups and Banquets, as it attacks the Melancholy in his ſolitary and ſullen retirements. The delight a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94435:91"/> boon Companion takes in being regal'd, and a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in being lov'd, have nothing of incompatibility betwixt them. It is only a going in queſt after Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure more than one way, and arriving at it by two different Roads. They are two different Roads in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, reply'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> and no Man can ever ſo deceive himſelf, as to believe, that to arrive at the <hi>Elizium</hi> of Love, he muſt travel through the ſordid Vail of a brutiſh voluptuouſneſs. It is a rare way indeed to charm a Lady, to accoſt her with thoſe nauſeous and brain-ſick Raptures, wherewith the drowſie Souls of the boon Companions, you mention, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes intoxicated? Would it not be a commendable excuſe, think ye, when a Lady ſhould deſire her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to pay a double aſſiduity and diligence to her ſervice, to oppoſe to her commands, a neceſſity of going to a <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> Rendevouz? And do you think, ſhe would not have great reaſon to be highly ſatisfi'd with this obliging Compliment, I ſhall not ſee you to morrow; I muſt ſpend the whole day in drinking with my Friends: where I ſhall encounter a thouſand pleaſures, which as you are not capable to give me, you are not like to ſhare with me; and ſome pleaſant Table diſcourſe, or other diverſions, will abundantly ſupply the want of your company.</p>
               <p>This ſatyrical raillery of <hi>Ovid,</hi> which he height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his drolling way of delivering it, and the Princeſs <hi>Julia</hi>'s ſeeming paſſionately to eſpouſe his quarrel againſt me, did ſo nettle me, that I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to ſtudy a revenge. I knew he affected <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and I found her a Perſon moſt worthy to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. I deſign'd, if it were poſſible, to diſappoint him of the heart of that fair one. I was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how ſenſible he would be of ſuch a loſs; and I was ambitious to demonſtrate to him by convincing
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94435:92"/> reaſons, that ingenious Debauchery is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the charms of Love.</p>
               <p>I was acquainted with the Daughter of <hi>Cicero,</hi> as one is acquainted with Perſons of Quality, whom they ſee in the Court either about the Empreſs, or the Princeſſes. I apply'd my ſelf with all diligence to gain a more particular acquaintance with her. I endeavor'd to oblige her by my ready ſervices, and the firſt occaſion I encounter'd, was at the Feaſt of the <hi>Bacchanales,</hi> which was that year govern'd by my directions; I made all the Parts of it allude to that Proverb of <hi>Cicero,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Sine <hi>Baccho</hi> Friget <hi>Venus;</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <l>Without the help of luſty <hi>Bacchus,</hi> Love</l>
                     <l>Grows cold, and cannot our dull ſpirits move.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And allegorizing to the ſenſe of the Proverb, I caus'd a <hi>Cupid</hi> to be plac'd upon one ſide of <hi>Bacchus</hi> his Statue, and both of them to be mounted upon one triumphal Chariot. They ſeem'd to have made mutual Preſents to each other; <hi>Cupid</hi> was crown'd with cluſters of Grapes, and carried a great Glaſs in his hand, inſtead of his Bowe; and a great-belly'd Bottle ſerv'd him for a Quiver, for his Arrows, and <hi>Bacchus</hi> wore the Quiver and Bowe, which <hi>Cupid</hi> wanted. Divers young Maids, habited like Painters, repreſenting the <hi>Menades</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> mix'd one among another, followed the Chariot, and with a diſorderly kind of order exchang'd employs with each other. The <hi>Menades</hi> diſtributed amongſt the People, thoſe Gallantries, which it only belong'd to Love to beſtow; and the <hi>Graces,</hi> officiouſly offer'd, to fill up full Glaſſes to any, that would receive them.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:94435:92"/>
               <p>You were then upon your Voyage towards <hi>Sicily,</hi> my Lord, and ſince <hi>Ovid</hi> has not related to you the particulars of our Cor-rival-ſhip, you are ignorant perhaps of that, which happen'd at that Feaſt. <hi>Tullia</hi> publickly declar'd, that ſhe was oblig'd to me, for giving ſo glorious a revive to the memory of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and whether <hi>Ovid</hi> was deſirous to put a flurr upon this favor of hers towards me or no, or only to railly me, I know not, but he compos'd a Poem, intituled,
<q>LOVE IN A RAGE.</q> Where feigning, that that God had fram'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt my Sacrilege, he made him thunder out ſevere Menaces and Imprecations againſt me.</p>
               <p>He had carried this piece of Gallantry to <hi>Tullia</hi>'s houſe, when ſhe happen'd not to be at home; and had left it upon a Table in her Chamber, that ſhe might find it at her return. I came thither a little after <hi>Ovid</hi> was gone; a young Slave, whom I had gain'd to my intereſts, told me, he had lately been there, and ſhew'd me the Paper he had left behind him. The indignation I conceiv'd to ſee my ſelf ſo much abus'd, rais'd the choler of my Muſe, and ſnatching up Pen and Paper, upon the ſame Title of <hi>Love in a Rage,</hi> I drew a draught of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancies. I folded up my Satyr, in the ſame form he had done his; I laid it upon the ſame Table; and juſt as I had finiſh'd my Cheat, <hi>Tullia</hi> came in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ovid</hi> uſher'd her, and had told her by the way, as they came, that he had left in her Chamber, a new emergency of his extravagant fancy. She thought to have found, what he ſpoke of, in the Paper, which lay in the place of the other, and ſnatching it up ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily, began to read,

               <p>It is not without cauſe, ſaid I, when <hi>Tullia</hi> had finiſh'd the reading the Verſes, that Love is ſo much enrag'd againſt that Lover, ſince he appears to be guilty of ſo many enormous crimes. Thoſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> briskly intertupting me, who impoſe this Rage upon Love, are ſo little capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding him, that none ought to judge of his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon their inconſiderable teſtimonies. They were without doubt in an elevated vein, when they bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth this Satyr, which is the froth rather of the giddy fumes of a ſtumm'd bottle, than a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to Love. I know not what the perſons are, you ſpeak of, ſaid I, without ſeeming at all to be mov'd, but methinks they have delineated ſo lively a draught of ingratitude, that they cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the oppoſite virtue, that they have Souls ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of noble paſſions; and that if they have found ſo ingenious a way to divert a Miſtriſs, and deſtroy a Rival, the froth of the bottle, which has inſpir'd this Art into them, ſeems to me to deſerve a place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the moſt politick ſtratagems of Love. To divert a Miſtriſs, and deſtroy a Rival? ſaid <hi>Ovid,</hi> Heavens! Can that ſort of People aſpire to ſo vain-glorious a conceit? Do they not underſtand, that living only for themſelves, Women know not whether there are any ſuch Animals in the World or no: That they regard their pretenſions to Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but like vaniſhing Dreams hatch'd in the <hi>capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> of an elevated brain; and that a tender Lover,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94435:95"/> would think he could not injure his Miſtriſs more, than to ſuſpect, ſhe could have the leaſt complaiſance for a perſon of that ſtamp. Be he of that ſtamp, or any other, ſaid <hi>Tullia</hi> interrupting him, I agree with you, that a Lady, who has a pre-engagement upon her, will not eaſily yield a complaiſance to a new A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; but if I had a Lover, I ſhould not love to ſee him ſo much an Opiniator, as to think, nothing elſe could pleaſe me: I would have him ſuſpicious of every thing, be jealous of the ingenuity of theſe Verſes, apprehenſive of ſome ſecret deſign in them, and in fine create to himſelf a thouſand little cares and dangers upon Subjects of the leaſt moment or probability. No Man upon earth, Madam, reply'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> comprehends the uſe and force of the cares and inquietudes you mention, better than my ſelf. But a Lover, Madam, becomes oftentimes more crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, in applying them ill, than in not reſenting them at all. We ought to underſtand the temper of the heart, we endeavor to charm; and if it be true, that Love derives its generous birth from the ſympathy of Souls, the Perſon I ſuſpect to be the Author of thoſe Verſes, I ſhall never triumph over a paſſionate and ſenſible Lover.</p>
               <p>I could then neither refute this Prophecy, nor comprehend what <hi>Tullia</hi> thought of it; two or three of the Ladies, who were cited in the Verſes, came to give <hi>Tullia</hi> a viſit, who made an earneſt ſign to us, not to mention a word of the premiſes before them. But the day after, my little Intelligencer came and brought me a Letter, which ſhe had gain'd by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize from a young <hi>Grecian,</hi> who ſerv'd <hi>Tullia,</hi> and by whom ſhe ſent it to <hi>Ovid;</hi> I open'd it, and read the following Contents.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94435:95"/>
                  <q>I begin now to be inroll'd in the number of your Caſt Miſtriſſes, your inconſtancy makes thoſe ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry toures; and you cannot longer love me, ſince <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> cannot make you jealous. My Women inform'd you, that he was two hours alone in my Chamber du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my abſence; and you ought to have ſuſpected, that he employ'd them in changing your Verſes; and ſo apparent a deſign to undermine you in your negligent ſecurity you regard only as a Poetical vanity. Was it your part to make ſo weak a remark? and are you not aſham'd to be fool'd into ſo eaſie a perſuaſion of that, which it is mine, to employ a thouſand cares and ſtratagems to beget in you?</q>
               </p>
               <p>I thought it not expedient to allow <hi>Tullia</hi> the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of making in Perſon theſe Reproaches to my Rival; I was doubtful of the ſucceſs. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I beg'd the favor of <hi>Cepion,</hi> who was our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Friend, but much more mine, than <hi>Ovids,</hi> to take him along with him to <hi>Domitius</hi>'s houſe, where he had deſign'd a Treat both of Munificence and Pleaſure to entertain his Friends: and at this time, <hi>Tullia</hi> leaving <hi>Rome</hi> to ſpend ſome dayes at this <hi>Villa</hi> where now we are, I ſeconded the reſentments which ſhe had already conceiv'd againſt him, with a declaration of my own Paſſion for her. I had by a ſmall gift or two above a month before, engag'd the Artificer to me, that made her Chariots; and I had experience of his Fidelity not long after; for, by deſign, her Chariot broke at the entrance into the Wood, which lies upon the right hand, as you come hither. I had caus'd a commodious Tent to be pitcht in that Wood, and prepar'd a Treat in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not improper for the occaſion, which was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a Set of choice Muſick; and all things
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94435:96"/> falling out as ſucceſsfully as I could deſire, I was there at hand to help <hi>Tullia</hi> out of the perplexity ſhe was embroil'd in. She was ſurpriz'd to meet on the Road with ſo unexpected an aſſiſtance. I told her, this was a preparation for one of thoſe pleaſant Debauches, which <hi>Ovid</hi> ſo often upbraided me with, that I waited for ſome of my Friends, with whom I had deſign'd to recreate my ſelf that day; but that I was highly oblig'd to them for their negligence, ſince the Gods had ſent me now much more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able company to ſupply their places; and juſt as I utter'd theſe laſt words, the Collation was ſerv'd in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tullia</hi> commended the elegancy of it, and told me, that if we made no other Debauches than thoſe, Ladies might be proud to participate of them; we pretend, Madam, ſaid I, ſo much to the honor of their companies at them, that they can afford us no real ſatisfaction, or guſt, without them. But <hi>Ovid</hi> is an Heretick in our Myſteries, who never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them in their purity. I have an ambition to preſent you with a true draught of them, which you will find far different from that you have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from him. I gave a ſign to the Muſick to ſtrike up; which they obey'd by an harmonious, yet brisk <hi>preludium,</hi> that much reviv'd the ſpirits of <hi>Tullia,</hi> after her little diſaſter upon the Road, and was followed with a Conſort of divers voices, which ſung theſe Verſes:
<q>
                     <l>A train of Servants trouble does create,</l>
                     <l>Who with their eyes devour us, and our meat,</l>
                     <l>Staring upon us like ſtarv'd Harpy-Elves;</l>
                     <l>Be gone, and let us eat our meat our ſelves.</l>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:94435:96"/>
                     <l>What? think ye, cannot we without a Spie</l>
                     <l>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon us, eat, or drink? Avant, for I</l>
                     <l>Love Secrecy as much at bords, as beds;</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Bacchus,</hi> as well as Love, makes jealous heads.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>My Servants were order'd before to retire upon this Sign, and the Muſick went on:
<q>
                     <l>Oh! how their abſence, does our hearts revive!</l>
                     <l>Their greedy eyes, which look'd, as they'rd etrieve</l>
                     <l>Each bit we eat, devour'd us up alive.</l>
                     <l>Let's ſpeak, we are alone, let's freely vent</l>
                     <l>Our thoughts, our ſecret Love, or Diſcontent,</l>
                     <l>And baniſh Fear; for <hi>Bacchus</hi> muſt excuſe</l>
                     <l>All thoſe, who frolick at his Rendevouz.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tullia</hi> ſeem'd to be a little ſtartled, when ſhe ſaw all my Servants withdraw, and the ſenſe of the laſt two couplets confirming her ſurprize; Oh! cry'd ſhe out, I have now a clear proſpect of your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the hazard I now run of my reputation, and the breaking of my chariot, are too much to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, not to give me a juſt apprehenſion of ſome deſign. Oh! Madam, ſuſpected of what? ſaid I, of an innocent deſign, of making you a paſſionate declaration of Love: Is this an attempt, which you ought to have a fearful apprehenſion of? You abuſe the confidence, <hi>Horace,</hi> ſaid <hi>Tullia,</hi> I was willing to repoſe in your Generoſity; and had not I ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſuffer'd my ſelf to be deceiv'd, when I was brought hither, you had not had now the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of making Diſcourſes to me, ſo void of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſincerity. Madam, I call the Gods to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſaid I, I never made any in my life, ſo full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and candor; and if you vouchſafe not to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94435:97"/> underſtand them ſo, you will do their Author a great injuſtice, who loves you more, than ever any perſon yet could pretend to love you. Neither the Corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valſhip of ſo fam'd an Oppoſite, as <hi>Ovid,</hi> nor the Prerogative he may plead to Antiquity, have power to diſcourage me in ſo glorious an attempt. It is a whole Month, ſince I have ſnatch'd at all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of opening this preſumptuous Declaration at your feet; but the aſſiduity of my Rival has always countermined mine: till now Fortune has at laſt be-friended my languiſhing impatience, with this bleſt one out of his preſence. Receive then the humble Petition of my Love, without rigor, or diſdain; my Rival only comes to make repetitions with you, of what he has preach'd in the Cloſets of all the Ladies of <hi>Rome.</hi> His method of making Love can pretend now no longer to the charms of a ſurprize, or the glory of a firſt offering, which are advantages mine comes attended with into your ſervice; and though you had no other deſign in allowing it a ſmall apartment in ſome bie-corner of your heart, than preſenting an Aſſociate, to Love, of my quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, he has preſented you with Graces enough, to merit from you ſo generous an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Juſt as I had ended my Diſcourſe, <hi>Ovid</hi> ſurpriz'd us with his unexpected arrival, who having met (as he was coming from <hi>Domitius</hi>'s) <hi>Tullia</hi>'s Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> to provide another Carriage (for that which was broken) for his Coach, was inform'd by him of the accident which had happen'd to his Miſtriſs, and he was now come to compliment her eſcape. The circumſtances he found her in, could not chooſe but give him an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind welcome. The Pavilion, under which we
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94435:97"/> were, ſeem'd to be imboſs'd all over with the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery of divers-colour'd flowers; which joining their natural Perfumes with many other rich eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherewith divers curious Jarrs and Caskets were fill'd, and plac'd in odoriferous ranks about it, ſeem'd to render it an <hi>Elizium,</hi> almoſt equal to that he had in his own Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ks prepar'd for happy Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. The Muſick was ſome of the choiceſt, that belong'd to the Emperor; and the relicks of our Collation declar'd, that without vanity it might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend both to Magnificence and Curioſity. But <hi>Ovid,</hi> who was not accuſtom'd to loſe the poſſeſſion of a heart, wherein he once had gain'd an intereſt, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that the paſſion he had for <hi>Tullia,</hi> was a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſecurity to aſſure him of the right he claim'd in hers: And when he underſtood ſhe had receiv'd no hurt by the accident of her Chariot, he ſeem'd to have no more concern for any thing elſe, than when he us'd to find her alone in her Chamber: I was not wanting to make <hi>Tullia</hi> ſenſible of this cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inſenſibility of his; you ſee, Madam, ſaid I ſoftly in her ear, that the Proteſtations of Love, which are render'd you at a Debauch, are more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere than thoſe you are wont ro receive in your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Cloſet; your Chariot broke by an accident, which only expos'd you to the hazard of honouring this place a few hours with your glorious preſence; and the Gods, by a ſpecial Providence, deſign'd me for your aſſiſtance. <hi>Ovid</hi> has ſurpriz'd us together, and is not jealous; but I, Madam, I am of his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow only; and would willingly purchaſe at the too inconſiderable value of all that I am worth, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of entertaining you one moment longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch envious witneſſes. Be you then, Madam, an impartial Judge, and declare, which in your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94435:98"/> merits the character of the moſt ſincere and the moſt paſſionate Lover.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe exaſperated the thoughts of <hi>Tullia,</hi> which were already diſpos'd to harbor a prejudice againſt <hi>Ovid,</hi> who had return'd no anſwer to her laſt Letter; and as ſhe was ignorant of the cauſe, ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted that to him as a crime, which was only an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of my Love. She beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n to railly upon him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a manner, which could not chooſe but trouble him, and I perceiv'd at that inſtant he was ſcarce able to digeſt it with patience. But he has ſince told <hi>Cepion</hi> (who related it to me again) that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd that impulſe of his diſdain, as a frenſie, which he thought would call his reaſon in queſtion, to have ſhewn himſelf capable of it. How? ſaid he to my Friend, could I imagine that a Soul, who had been train'd up by my Maxims to the Myſteries of Love, ſhould be debauch'd by <hi>Horace?</hi> The Gods ſeem'd never to ſuffer me to awake in a Morning, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to my Miſtriſs the dreams they inſpir'd into my fancy at Night, ſhe finds that the devotion I have for her, cauſes me to pay a daily one to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhe frequents. She neither makes a viſit, nor takes walk, whereat my diligent obſervance does not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her. My regards, my diſcourſes, the happy rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of my Muſe, all offer ſacrifice to my Love; I neither think, nor act, but to improve its intereſt with her. <hi>Horace</hi> is a Libertine, whoſe whole life, like a Comical Repreſentation, is divided only into divers Scenes, of Play, Banquets, Revels, Publick Spectacles, and other leud diverſions. What leiſure could he find to cultivate a Love-intrigue? or what frenſie or <hi>capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> could invade <hi>Tullia,</hi> to prefer ſuch a Rival before me? This <hi>capricio,</hi> if it might be call'd one, deriv'd its birth from the converſe of that day, I now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94435:98"/> 
                  <hi>Tullia</hi> has told me ſince, that ſhe found the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of my Love very ſingular; which I found means afterwards likewiſe to illuſtrate, with two or three Gallantries more, as unexpected, as the Treat in the Wood. We accompanied <hi>Tullia</hi> home to this <hi>Villa;</hi> for I underſtood, that her Chariot would return ſo late from home, that ſuch a Convoy would not be unwelcome to her. At a convenient place upon the Road, ſhe was encounter'd with a Troop of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes, with the ſound of divers Countrey Inſtruments, with a kind of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick triumph, conducted her home to her houſe; and ſome of them diſguiz'd like Gypſies, danc'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her after the Gypſie-manner; and theſe diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements employing her time before Supper, a Set of Comedians, who pretended they had loſt their way, and beg'd entertainment there that night, took up moſt part of it, in repreſenting the furies of <hi>Ajax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I counterfeited the ignorant, and made proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that I was ſurpriz'd at theſe comick Novelties; but this was too courſe a ſpun web, to delude a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ovids</hi> perſpicacity. He rag'd, he reproach'd <hi>Tullia,</hi> and interpreting her denial of having given the leaſt conſent, or encouragement to theſe ruſtical diverſions a criminal diſſimulation, he was almoſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd to that point of jealouſie, as <hi>Tullia</hi>'s wiſhes could have exacted from him; but as her innocence was wholly unworthy of his accuſations, and he thought he diſcover'd the real marks of it in the motions of her countenance, he relaps'd into his old Lethargy, of a calm ſecurity and repoſe.</p>
               <p>We return'd both together to <hi>Rome,</hi> where ſome commands of <hi>Mecoenas</hi> detain'd him much againſt his will, at the time of <hi>Tullia</hi>'s ſojourn in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. My diligence was not wanting to give that the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94435:99"/> colour of a negligence, which I knew to be a bare neceſſity; and redoubling my bounty and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Slave I had gain'd to my devotion, I play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my game ſo well, that <hi>Ovid</hi> had no opportunity of juſtifying his long abſence, nor <hi>Tullia</hi> of receiving any Letter from him; but was abſolutely convinc'd, that he was the moſt cold and tepid Lover in the world. As this error and remiſsneſs of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Love gain'd ſtrength daily in the imagination of <hi>Tullia</hi> to his prejudice, I endeavor'd as firmly to fix in it an oppoſite character of my own. There did not a day paſs, during her abſence from <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein I did not regale her with ſome novel diverſion, or other. I found out a young <hi>Grecian,</hi> who had a moſt excellent voice and method in ſinging, and I preſented her to her. I underſtood ſhe had deſign'd a day of hunting with two or three Ladies more her Neighbours, I met them, as by accident, at their Rendevouz, with a Pack of Hounds, whoſe beauty and harmony far excell'd any they had with them; and having enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd them with that ſport, in a greater perfection than they expected, I gave them a noble Treat, to refreſh the pleaſant toils they had undergone in the purſuit of it. Theſe obliging Services, my Letters, my diſcourſes, and the reſentments of <hi>Tullia,</hi> which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the preſence, nor diligence of <hi>Ovid</hi> endeavor'd to qualifie, wrought the effect I deſir'd. In fine, my Lord, my ſuit was not diſpleaſing to her; and the firſt alarum <hi>Ovid</hi> took of it, was from two or three Stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes, I had compos'd in the tranſports of a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch, which <hi>Tullia</hi> was pleas'd to honor with her preſence. I ſhall repeat them to you, and you ſhall judge whither he had not ſome cauſe to be diſturb'd.

And am I the firſt of Women, whom his charms have ſurpriz'd? But, Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:94435:100"/> my Rival, I have long lov'd the adorable <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and you have given me leave to believe, that I was not hated of her: But, ſaid <hi>Tullia,</hi> you neither expreſt a concern, nor jealouſie towards your Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; and Love cannot lodge in a breaſt, out of which thoſe two ſenſible Gueſts are baniſh'd. Ah! Madam, exclaim'd that afflicted Lover, if that were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaſon you could alledge for a ground of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant ſeverity, it would have long ſince vented it ſelf in a thouſand reproaches, and ſo ill-humor'd a converſe have had its abortive birth long before this unhappy Minute: But you never lov'd me, a real Love does never terminate in ſo excentrick a Point; no, no, you are not unconſtant, this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended levity, is only the vizard-mark to your real diſſimulation. What? have I ſtudied hearts ſo long, to be ignorant of their character? Can a Miſtriſs, like a Bird out of its Cage, flie from me, and I not ſee which way ſhe takes her flight? Love, ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Love, get thee another Panegyriſt, provide thee another Hiſtorian, I am no longer able to trace thee through thy myſterious Meanders, which are as blind as thy ſelf; or, I ſhould more properly ſay, that thy chiefeſt Myſteries, are nothing now, but myſtick <hi>Chimera's.</hi> It is in <hi>Horace</hi>'s power to leave <hi>Ovid</hi> deſtitute of a Miſtriſs; thou haſt no longer eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Laws to govern by, ſince Fortune ſits at the Helm, and ſteers at her pleaſure the Fate of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agrippa</hi> found this Exclamation ſo pleaſant, that he was forc'd to interrupt <hi>Horace</hi> with a loud Fit of laughter; I am ſo well acquainted, ſaid he, with <hi>Ovid</hi>'s tranſports, that, as much a Friend as I am to his concerns, I believe, as you ſay, his affliction would have prov'd my diverſion, had I been a witneſs to it.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:94435:100"/>
               <p>It is not poſſible, my Lord, reply'd <hi>Horace,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to you the pleaſant extravagancy of it. He thought that the whole Adventure, had been only the abortion of a deluſive Dream; he came to me, and ask'd me ſeriouſly, if it were true, that <hi>Tullia</hi> lov'd me; and whether it were not only a Project to render me more obſequious and circumſpect for the future; but when, by the air of my countenance, and the cold reception he found from her, he was convinc'd, that I had uſurp'd the Throne, he had been ſo long in poſſeſſion of, he vented his rage in ſuch vollies of imprecations, as better deſerv'd to be inſerted in his Work, than all his Elegies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Horace</hi> could no longer dilate himſelf on the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his triumphs; for one of <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s Servants came to advertiſe his Lord, that he thought the Emperor expected his attendance. They found him with the Ladies in a ſpacious Meadow, whoſe flowry head repoſing it ſelf betwixt two chryſtal Arms of <hi>Tyber,</hi> was crown'd with a rich Balliſter of white Marble. The Emperor had purpoſely drawn all the company to that place, to the end they might not diſcover, that which was preparing to entertain them in another; and having detain'd them there until the evening, he on a ſudden ſurpriz'd them with the moſt delightful object their eyes were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Tullia</hi>'s houſe ſeem'd to be inclos'd in a caſe of ſtars, compos'd by an infinite number of torches, which cover'd it over, that it reſembled a Flaming Caſtle, rais'd there <hi>extempore,</hi> by the force of ſome Magical Enchantment. The inter-ſpaces betwixt the lights were form'd with red canvas, ſtamp'd with divers figures, which by the reflexion of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches plac'd behind it, repreſented ſo many flaming
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94435:101"/> Proſpects. The Walk of the Gardens were fill'd with Pyramids, and Figures, rais'd by the ſame arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And from the top of a high Turret, which crown'd the Houſe, at a certain ſign the Emperor caus'd to be given, a thouſand hiſſing Dragons and Serpents took their flight into the clouds, which on every ſide preſented, to the aſtoniſh'd eyes of the Spectators, the glorious name of <hi>Terentia</hi> in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of fire and flames.</p>
               <p>But yet this Wonder was no Miracle. The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Monarchs, as great as it is, muſt ſubſcribe to the Laws of Impoſſibility: For <hi>Caeſar</hi> had only apply'd that to this occaſion, which he had long before prepar'd for another; But the Myſtery being unknown to the Ladies, Oh! Sir, cry'd <hi>Terentia,</hi> the Heavens employ themſelves on all occaſions to work Miracles for you, and they have certainly ſome ſupernatural deſign in this they here repreſent unto us. It is rather you, Madam, reply'd the amorous <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who are ſo precious to the care of the Gods, as being the greateſt Miracle in the whole Catalogue of their Works, who has oblig'd them to Preſent us with this Scene of Wonders. The Gods, reply'd <hi>Terentia,</hi> do indeed accumulate with their favors, when the hands of the mighty <hi>Caeſar</hi> vouchſafe to diſtribute them to me.</p>
               <p>Theſe diſcourſes, or the like, having entertain'd them, till they came to a large Portal, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them into a fair Hall, they paſt into it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an odoriferous Arch fram'd with the beautiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Flowers, and richeſt Greens the Univerſe could afford, where a Table attended them, laden with the variety of the choiceſt rarities, wherewith nature could furniſh it. A Ball, worthy the Magnificence of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> concluded this Royal Treat, perform'd by
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:94435:101"/> that illuſtrious Company in a Room wainſcoted all round with Looking-glaſſes of the pureſt Chryſtal, which multiplying the Gallantry of ſo many noble Objects, exhibited divers repreſentations of that, which at that time was ſingular in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
               <p>The unexpected Arrival of <hi>Aurora,</hi> who, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to be a Spectatrix of ſo glorious a Triumph, peep'd in upon them at the Window, prorogued this illuſtrious Convention: Ten or twelve light Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots richly gilt and figur'd, convey'd them back to <hi>Rome; Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Terentia</hi> mounted one: The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> by his command, were plac'd in another: <hi>Tullia,</hi> (who would wait upon her noble Gueſts to the Gates of the City) <hi>Fulvia, Varentilla, Agrippa, Horace,</hi> the Princeſſes Maids of Honor, and the Officers of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Train, ſorted themſelves, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to their quality or inclination, whil'ſt <hi>Virgil</hi> alone, preferring the devoires of an entire friendſhip, before all the triumphs and delights <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>'s houſe could ſatiate him with, follow'd <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> to <hi>Tuſculum,</hi> whither the preſence of <hi>Caeſar</hi> had oblig'd him to retire.</p>
               <p>He was fallen into diſgrace with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and had receiv'd a command from him, to abſent himſelf from his preſence for ever. He went to <hi>Rome</hi> to make an humble Addreſs, and was deſirous to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt <hi>Terentia</hi> in his Suit: And to confer with her, he had follow'd her to <hi>Tullia</hi>'s <hi>Villa;</hi> but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Arrival had prevented his deſign; and oblig'd him, as I ſaid before, to retire to ſome neighbouring place.</p>
               <p>When he ſaw <hi>Virgil,</hi> he began to oppoſe himſelf, as earneſtly as he could, againſt this demonſtration of his generoſity and friendſhip. Return, return,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:94435:102"/> ſaid he, my dear <hi>Virgil,</hi> to the place where I thought I had left you; and affect not the company of an unfortunate Wretch, whoſe diſgrace may prove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious. Sovereigns love to ſee the Acts of their Indignation authoriz'd by the Suffrages of Perſons of Honeſty and Honor; and you caſt a reproach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when you conſerve a kindneſs for a Man, whom his diſpleaſure has condemn'd to his eternal hatred. <hi>Virgil</hi> is not a perſon ſo conſiderable in the Empire, reply'd <hi>Virgil,</hi> as to deſerve to have Spies to attend his Actions, or Excurſions. The Policy, you ſpeak of, concerns only ſuch, as either by their Birth, or Employs, are deſtin'd to ſtand, as living Examples, before the People. And what in a Perſon of that Remark and Quality would be held for a neceſſary Prudence, would be condemn'd as a ridiculous Vanity in one of mine. Your Honor is dazled by your Modeſty, ſaid <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and you are doubtleſs more conſiderable in the Opinion of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> than your own. The Fame of a Poet is oftentimes as neceſſary to ſignalize the glory of Heroes, as their own virtue; And thoſe, who now admire the Valor of <hi>Achilles,</hi> had perhaps never heard of his Name, had not the Pen of <hi>Homer</hi> eterniz'd it. Theſe kind of Flatteries, ſaid <hi>Virgil,</hi> intoxicates the Reaſon, and by aſſes the Pens of the greateſt part of Authors; who fanſie themſelves to be the Authors indeed of the Fate and Deſtiny of Heroes and Princes, and murmur againſt the ſmall regard the World has of their Merits, as a moſt criminal Injuſtice. But to frame a right judgment of things, what do we ſerve for? In what are Princes oblig'd to us? There was never yet a Poet ſo audacious, as to arraign the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Prince living, and with his Scepter in his hand, at the Bar of <hi>Parnaſſus;</hi> and the juſteſt Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:94435:102"/> he beſtows upon him, are ſuſpected of flattery and vain-glory. The contempt, or approbation of great Ones, does either depreſs, or elevate our works; and we ſing in vain their glorious Geſts, if the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Memoires give us the Lye. Theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alone, ought in my judgment, to degrade a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Scribler of all Favor with his Prince, who may acquire more true glory, than his pureſt Ink can fix upon him, by rewarding him for thoſe good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he ſtands in no need of. I would have a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Integrity be juſt to himſelf in the firſt place, give each action its due character, and without ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping one, as much for his own advantage, as his Princes, conſider, that he ſtands accountable for the Power, the Gods have inveſted him with, to none but themſelves, from the firſt Minute they rank'd him amongſt Crowned Heads. Would it had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Heaven, cry'd <hi>Cornelius,</hi> to have imprinted this Maxim in my Soul! I had then ſtill been in poſſeſſion of my Emperors good grace, and the Government he honor'd me with. But the luſtre of my place, from whence I ſtood towring over the heads of other Mortals, did ſo dazle the eyes of my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that I could not diſcern the track, by which I climb'd the dangerous Precipice: and without conſidering, that not like the Sun, I was my ſelf the Author of thoſe Rayes, which my Greatneſs darted from its glorious Orb, it appear'd ſo bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to me, that I perſuaded my ſelf it was abſolute and independent. And whil'ſt a juſt apprehenſion contain'd me within the limits of my duty, I ſet ſuch a value upon my ſervices, and eſteem'd them ſo important, that I fancy'd they might challenge that injuſtice for their reward, which was the ſole
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:94435:103"/> effect of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s bounty. But, ſaid <hi>Virgil,</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, what caus'd you to commit ſo grand an overſight? The Emperor has alwayes teſtify'd ſo great a kindneſs for you, that though the Gods had not deſtin'd him both for yours, and the Worlds Maſter, a Maxim of pure gratitude only ought to have fix'd all your endeavors to his ſervice.</p>

               </head>
               <p>LOVE, my dear <hi>Virgil,</hi> reply'd <hi>Cornelius,</hi> is a weakneſs, which has always triumpht over the ſtrongeſt reſolutions of the greateſt Heroes: That alone has been the Author of my Crime; and from what alone I hope a pardon. You have heard me diſcourſe formerly of a fair Slave, which belonged to the Philoſopher <hi>Volumnius,</hi> and was made free by him, named <hi>Cytheris,</hi> whom you ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, in one of your Ecclogues, under the name of <hi>Licoris;</hi> and who, I told you, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied <hi>Mark Antony,</hi> when the Male-content took his laſt farewel of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have often ſince declar'd to you, with what an incredible grief I entertain'n the news of her flight; and you your ſelf were ſo ſenſibly toucht therewith, that in one of your Poems, you made your Muſe the chief Mourner of the dolorous obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies of my Love; which ought not in juſtice to have been ſo effeminate, ſince I was only depriv'd of the ſight of an Object, which I could not chooſe,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94435:104"/> but adore; for as to a paſſion, or inclination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any other perſon, ſhe was wholly incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it; and her Soul was as inſenſible of the Flames of <hi>Antony,</hi> as of mine.</p>
               <p>But yet my jealouſie could not be convinc'd of the contrary; and the ſcorn and indignation, I conceiv'd at the thoughts of anothers being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before me, join'd to the buſie Employs of the charge <hi>Caeſar</hi> had conferred upon me, in a ſhort time baniſht the Idea of <hi>Cytheris</hi> ſo perfectly out of my breaſt, that methought no part of it lurkt behind to keep an unquiet poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>She was now longer the grief of my eyes, or of my thoughts. I eagerly followed my Sports and Recreations, and without diſtraction, dedicated my ſelf to the employs of my Charge. Which one day oblig'd me to aſſiſt in perſon at a Survey, which was taken along the <hi>Nilus,</hi> for the the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitating the famous inundation of its fertile Streams: when one of my people came to me, and told me, that in one of the inhabitable Iſlands, with which that River is chequer'd all over, was heard the accent of an human Voice; and askt me if it were my pleaſure, that ſome one or other, ſhould go and inform himſelf of the truth of it.</p>
               <p>The perſon that brought me this intelligence, wanted not ability for a more important employ; but a ſecret curioſity, the cauſe whereof I was ignorant of, poſſeſt me with a deſire, to go and make it my ſelf. I took a Bark, and boarded the Iſland; when I was ſtrangely ſurpriz'd, for the firſt Object my eyes were fixt on, was to encounter that ſame <hi>Cytheris,</hi> for whom I had had ſo ardent and ſo ineffectual a Paſſion.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:94435:104"/>
               <p>She was a little impair'd in her Beauty; and five or ſix years ſpace, wherein I had not ſeen here, is able to change the air of any countenance; but my Heart, through my eclips'd Eyes, diſcover'd her. A ſudden tranſport of joy and fear, which at the ſame moment invaded my Soul, ſuggeſted to me, that it was <hi>Cytheris,</hi> whom I beheld.</p>
               <p>What new <hi>Theſeus?</hi> cry'd I out, or rather what inhuman Tyger, has abandon'd you in this inhoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable Deſart? Durſt <hi>Mark Antony</hi> commit ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous a Crime? Or <hi>Cleopatra</hi> ſo imperious a cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to lay ſuch commands upon her effeminate Paramour. And could the tame Gods hold their revengeful Thunder in their hands, and behold the Sacriledge? <hi>Mark Antony,</hi> reply'd <hi>Cytheris,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting me with a fair look, has not been the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter of my deſtiny; I effected it my ſelf, and ſhall purſue it to the uttermoſt period of my life. Ah! <hi>Cytheris,</hi> ſaid I, ingratude never merited before ſuch glorious expreſſions. It was enough for you to play the cruel thief, to rob me of my Heart, and carry it in triumph after that Ingrate, without interdicting me the juſt liberty of reproaching his infidelity. Yqu never had a perfect knowledge of me, reply'd <hi>Cytheris</hi> coldly; and your ſuſpitions now are as imperfect, as that was before. I did not follow <hi>Mark Antony;</hi> he did not abandon me; and if I had been capable of ſuch a weakneſs for one of the two, perhaps I ſhould not have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted it in his favor: But a certain repugnance, which at firſt ſeem'd to have no real foundation, and which ſince I have diſcover'd too juſt grounds for, caus'd me to regard the proſecution of your Amour, as a moſt troubleſome perſecution. It was that I fled from; againſt that did I endeavor to find a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:94435:105"/> Come, my Lord, Come and take a view of that, the gods have here aſſigned me, and ſuffer me quietly to enjoy without the diſtra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>As ſhe uttered theſe laſt words, ſhe conducted me by a little path, to the moſt pleaſant ſolitude I ever beheld. The Trees of one continued Wood, which extending their ſpacious Arms to each other, like one large Umbrella, cover over the ſurface of the whole Iſland, ſeem on purpoſe to open them in in this place, to frame a delightful Walk for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures diverſion; which declining by an inſenſible deſcent, invites you into a pleaſant Meadow, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided in the middle by the rapid ſtreams of a Chriſtal Torrent. <hi>Flora,</hi> which ſeem'd to have choſen it for her ruſtick Nurſery, had enamell'd it all over with a ſort of wild, yet beautiful Flowers, not common in thoſe parts of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of a certain old Man, who with <hi>Cytheris,</hi> and one perſon more, were both the Subjects, and Sovereign of this charming Deſart, had furniſh'd it with all neceſſaries for the ſupport of human life. There were two or three Cabins, which ſeeming to be built, more by advice of Nature than Art, with green Boughs and Branches, made but a weak reſiſtance againſt the inclemency of the Air. There were likewiſe Beaſts both wild and domeſtick; and a ſmall Tract of Land, which cleanſed from Weeds, and other traſh, furniſh'd this little Family with Corn, and all other Field, and Garden Proviſions.</p>
               <p>I fancied my ſelf to be in one of thoſe inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed places, deſcrib'd by the Poets; and looking
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94435:105"/> ſometimes upon <hi>Cytheris,</hi> and then upon the old Man (who taking no notice of me, follow'd, I know not what pudling employment he was then about) I began to rub my eyes, like one, who would endeavor to clear them of ſome cloud or miſt, that was before them.</p>

               <p>This excellent diſcourſe begat in me ſuch tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports of love and admiration, that I had not the power to Maſter them. I gave her a thouſand tender embraces within my incircling Arms; And oh! moſt divine Creature, ſaid I, worthy the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the whole Univerſe, Come and reſtore to it that Miracle, this ſolitude has unjuſtly rob'd it of. You merit all the Empires of the World, but the Emperor, who has the power to Inthrone you in them, wanting the perfect knowledge of that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:94435:106"/> which may entitle you to them; Come at leaſt and repreſent in <hi>Alexandria</hi> the perſon of a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Empreſs; Come and reign an abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign over him, who reigns with abſolute authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over the Subjects of the <hi>Ptolomies.</hi> No, no, ſaid <hi>Cytheris</hi> to me, thruſting me from her with her hand, If the pleaſure of the gods had deſign'd me for the place, you propoſe, they would have elevated me to it themſelves; and ſo eſtabliſh'd my Anceſtors in it, that a juſt deſcent ſhould have conferr'd it upon me, had they not judged this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition more happy for me, to which they have now reduc'd me. I have ſpoken to you only yet in the quality of a Lover, anſwer'd I, but now you compel me to ſpeak to you, in the quality of the Praetor of <hi>Egypt;</hi> which obliges me to ſee Juſtice duly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in this Province; and I ſhould infringe this duty, ſhould I ſuffer a barbarous Iſland to entomb alive a perſon, whoſe virtues declare to me, that ſhe came into the World only to command it. Both as a Lover and a Praetor, ſaid <hi>Cytheris,</hi> interrupting me, you ought to ſubmit to my will. Love is never unaccompanied with ſubmiſſion, and the Praetor of <hi>Egypt</hi> has no juriſdiction over a perſon of my Birth.</p>
               <p>I was very importunate with <hi>Cytheris</hi> to draw her out of her Solitude, or at leaſt a clearer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery out of her, of her intentions. But I was not able to move her to grant either of my requeſts: ſhe deſir'd me to return again to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I carry'd my new re-inkindled Flame, which broke forth with ſuch violence, out of the embers it had bhen ſo long ſmothered in, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to ſtay there above a day or two, without taking a ſecond Voyage to ſee her. She
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:94435:106"/> ſhew'd me all the ordinary employs with which ſhe did divert herſelf. <hi>Volumnius,</hi> as you know, is a perſon generally accompliſht with all Sciences: who finding the Soul of <hi>Cytheris</hi> capable to receive all thoſe noble tinctures, he had a deſire to infuſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, he had render'd her an abſolute Miſtris in all Philoſophical erudition. It was this, which I found ſo charming in her, when firſt I began to have a paſſion for her; and which oblig'd <hi>Volum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> to enfranchiſe her. To this excellent orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe had many others; and had as great a care of her education, as if her Birth had been known to him. She ſpoke naturally the Greek Tongue; play'd gracefully upon two or three inſtruments; limm'd and embroder'd in perfection; And the old Man that was with her, had procur'd all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for her, to keep thoſe admirable Talents in practice.</p>
               <p>Do you not think, ſaid ſhe to me, that theſe employs are ſufficient to entertain with ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and delight the whole courſe of that momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry being, allow'd us here on Earth? And do you believe, that the glories and pleaſures of your <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Alexandria,</hi> are more really pleaſures and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, than thoſe I enjoy in this ſolitude? Worldly diverſions are the ſame to the Soul, that ſhows, or ſpectacles are to the Eyes. They draw it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, tire it, but not revive it; they always leave a <hi>vacuum</hi> in it, which they cannot fill; and as they continually diſtract it with new deſires, ſo do they baniſh from it all peace and tranquility. But, <hi>Cytheris,</hi> cry'd I, tranſported with an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her virtue, how could you, being both of a Sex and Age ſo tender, arrive ſo early to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations ſo ſolid? And having attain'd them, cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94435:107"/> them in ſo wild a School as this is? Every perſon, reply'd the diſcreet <hi>Cytheris,</hi> has inherent in himſelf thoſe neceſſary principles, by which he may attain to Wiſdom. The skilfulleſt Artificer commits faults enough in his Art, to convince him, he is not infallible; yet thoſe faults themſelves lead him to perfection. Allow a man of that degree, modeſty, and a deſire of knowledge, and you ſhall render him wiſe in his Element. All other ſttates of life, furniſh thoſe, that are in them, with the like advantages. For my own particular, I have experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced two or three different conditions; I was born a Slave, nor knew I, till after my Enfranchiſement, hew far my birth ought to have been remov'd from ſo inglorious an obſcurity. From whence I learnt, that ſlavery is no real evil, ſince I ſupported it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regret; and an illuſtrious deſcent no real good, ſince I poſſeſt it, and yet was not ſenſible of it. <hi>Antonies</hi> love was a long time the ſole felicity of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> but not of <hi>Cytheris:</hi> And why? becauſe that kind of love has no real commerce with true felicity: if it had, it would have wrought its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in me, as well as in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Queen; but the extravagant imagination and fancy of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, caus'd her to regard that, as a great good, which mine repreſented to me, as a greater evil; and thoſe kind of imaginations do create the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the felicity, or infelicity incident to Mortals. Poſſeſs them with the charming ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a private life, and this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mediocrity ſhall render them more happy than the dazling luſtre of Crowns and Scepters: Place before them for their Object, Honors and Dignities, and they ſhall become the prey of an inſatiable Ambition. I have made it a long time my chief ſtudy, to combat
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94435:107"/> within my ſelf this capricious folly, and I find, that a Sovereign Power, is not ſo real a felicity, as a power within ones ſelf, to regard the loſs of it without regret. Ah! Madam, ſaid I, (for I made no ſcruple now to give her that title) tell me I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, from what glorious height you have ſtoopt to this humble diſguiſe, that I may pay my due adorations to that virtue, which cauſes you to deſpiſe it. The ſtate of my preſent being, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to great revolutions; fortifie it therefore with ſome eminent example, that if occaſion ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, may prove an Antidote for me againſt the envious Malice of never conſtant fortune.</p>
               <p>I judg'd by the motion of <hi>Cytheris</hi> her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that ſhe was about to ſatisfie my curioſity, when her companion came in haſte to tell her, that <hi>Ambiorix</hi> (which was the old Mans name) was ſtung with a venemous Serpent: and that from the knowledge he had of ſuch kind of wounds, he concluded he had not two hours to live. <hi>Cytheris</hi> grew pale, and running with great diſtraction to the Cabin of <hi>Ambiorix</hi> (whither I follow'd her) Oh! my dear Father, ſaid ſhe to him, What mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune has arriv'd to you? Is it as fatal as <hi>Phila</hi> cauſes me to apprehend? And is it poſſible the gods will deprive me of your aſſiſtance and conduct? What name was that I heard you pronounce, my Lord? ſaid <hi>Virgil,</hi> interrupting him; Was it not the name of <hi>Phila?</hi> I, reply'd <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who together with <hi>Cytheris</hi> and <hi>Ambiorix,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited that Iſland, was ſo call'd. Oh! my Lord, added <hi>Virgil,</hi> ſpeak I beſeech you, Was not this Maid an <hi>Athenian?</hi> And did not the Orator <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochus</hi> her Father, to elude the effect of ſome predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which were denounc'd to him, cauſe her to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:94435:108"/> be privately convey'd into <hi>Sicily;</hi> And did ſhe not under the name of <hi>Plautia,</hi> make ſome ſojourn in <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She is the ſame, you ſpeak of, reply'd <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and whom you ſo lately mention'd in your recital of <hi>Milo</hi>'s Adventure. She gain'd an acquaintance with <hi>Cytheris</hi> in the houſe, from whence we late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came; where <hi>Cicero</hi> detain'd her, as a priſoner, to force her conſent to marry him; and near which, his neighbor <hi>Volumnius</hi> had another. <hi>Cytheris</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on reſolutions, to quit <hi>Rome,</hi> for the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations before-named; <hi>Plautia</hi> conjur'd her to give her leave to accompany her. They came into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> and this conformity of their fortunes, has combin'd them together in the bonds of ſo firm an Amity, that they are ſtill together in ſome part of the World, which my moſt curious ſearch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcover.</p>
               <p>Oh! my Lord, cry'd <hi>Virgil,</hi> let us travel the whole Univerſe in queſt of this place. I can no longer lend attention to your diſcourſe; and can enjoy no felicity in any part of my life, but that I ſhall dedicate to the ſearch of <hi>Phila.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Would it might pleaſe the Gods, ſaid <hi>Cornelius,</hi> purſuing his diſcourſe, that at the expence of never ſeeing my ſelf more in the good grace of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> I might hope for a fortunate ſucceſs of ſo glorious a queſt: I would this very minute commence it; but it has coſt me already ſo many toileſome and unprofitable ſteps, that I dare not any more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it. Yet I requeſt you, not to defer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the reaſons you have to expreſs ſo tender a concern for <hi>Phila;</hi> and I ſhall willingly refer the reſt of my Relation to another ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Finiſh it, I pray you, my Lord, reply'd <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:94435:108"/> I beg your pardon for having interrupted it; I was not Maſter of my ſudden tranſport; but my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has now re-aſſumed its Seat, and I entreat you to tell me, what became of the wound of <hi>Ambiorix.</hi> It prov'd mortal, as he himſelf foreſaw, ſaid <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius;</hi> and before it wrought its laſt inevitable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, he made a declaration to <hi>Cytheris,</hi> which, though it charm'd not my Love, yet it charm'd my Ears: I ſhall not repreſent to you, Madam, ſaid he, that your birth challeng'd for your Grandfather, the renowned King <hi>Viridomare,</hi> which ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the liberty of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> againſt the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Tyranny: Theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons infuſe generally more vanity than true wiſdom; and he can entitle himſelf to eſſential Virtue, that can only claim it from his Anceſtors. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you to remember, that the Gods have endu'd you with a firmity of courage, and a ſolidity of judgment above the ordinary capacity of your Sex: That they have beſtow'd this Bleſſing upon you, not without myſtery or deſign; and that they will exact from you a ſevere account of the Talents, they have given you. I made a faithful promiſe to the laſt of the Race, of the <hi>Viridomares,</hi> your Father, and my Maſter, to inſtill into your tender Soul, theſe laudable Principles. And now I ſhall dye with ſatisfaction, ſince I have ſo fortunately acquitted my ſelf of my devoir; but yet I have done nothing, unleſs you crown it with a glorious perſeverence. Eſtabliſh the repoſe of my Soul af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my death, by an invincible magnanimity; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your ſelf always in ſuch a ſtate of Virtue, that you may be always a glory and ſatisfaction to your ſelf; And above above all, Remember to keep this Maxim for ever engrav'd in the center
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:94435:109"/> of your Heart, that you ought to be the Heir of the Sacred, and inveterate hatred of the <hi>Viridomares</hi> againſt the barbarous <hi>Romans;</hi> and that upon this condition, and no other, you receiv'd from your dying Father, that Benediction, which Heaven has decreed ſhould propagate the felicity of Children upon Earth.</p>
               <p>Theſe laſt words concluded his life, and caſt <hi>Cytheris</hi> into an affliction, ſcarce to be imagin'd, much leſs expreſſed. The eminent danger to which this misfortune expos'd her, alone, deſtitute of all relief, or ſuccor, in a wild Deſart; and the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of <hi>Phila,</hi> who repreſented to her, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Ambiorix,</hi> ſhe ought not to make a longer ſojourn in it, without calling her diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and honor in queſtion, caus'd her to embrace a reſolution of ſeeking another Sanctuary. I invited her to a houſe of pleaſure, which ſome of the <hi>Ptoleme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Kings had built ſome few miles diſtant from <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and the Governors of <hi>Egypt</hi> had preſerv'd for their own. There I learnt of her, that after the death of King <hi>Viridomare,</hi> who was ſlain by <hi>Marcellus</hi> in a ſingle Combat, the Prince his Son, whoſe Daughter ſhe was, had rov'd a long time from Kingdom to Kingdom, to implore their aid to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his own; and ſeeing that he courted it in vain, he had, contrary to the cuſtom of that Nation, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd himſelf to the ſtudy of Philoſophy; That he had made choice of <hi>Egypt</hi> for his retirement; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe learning flouriſh'd no where then, but in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and he was too well known in the firſt of the two. That his Queen, who was then great with Child, travelling under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Ambiorix,</hi> to find him out, had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred by a party of the <hi>Roman</hi> Troops, who
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:94435:109"/> made her a Slave, and ſold her to <hi>Volumnius.</hi> That her Father had arriv'd to the knowledge of her death, without knowing any thing of her being ſafely diſcharged of the Burden ſhe went with; and that being moſt moſt ſenſibly toucht with this laſt misfortune, he had confin'd the mournful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of his life to that Solitude, from whence I had lately drawn <hi>Cytheris.</hi> That a few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, he had been inform'd by a Slave, which <hi>Volumnius</hi> us'd oftentimes to ſend to ſearch the Iſlands of <hi>Nilus,</hi> for Plants, whoſe Virtue he was deſirous to experiment, That his Wife had left a Daughter behind her, and that <hi>Volumnus</hi> had caus'd her to be educated with great care and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and that dying, he had ſtrictly charg'd <hi>Ambiorix</hi> to omit no endeavors for the regaining his Daughter out of the power of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ambiorix</hi> had with fidelity acquitted himſelf of this Commiſſion, as I have told you; and fortune ſo ordering it, that <hi>Cytheris</hi> ſhould take her ſecret flight out of <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſame day that <hi>Mark Antony</hi> left it, ſwelling with revenge and diſcontent, I was poſſeſt with a jealouſie, that <hi>Cytheris</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd. I am oblig'd hourly to pay the Gods a million of thanks, Madam, ſaid I to her, when ſhe had ended her diſcourſe, that the veneration and zeal, you expreſs for executing the laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of your Father, has conducted you into a Province, where my duty obliges me to reſide, and gives me now the opportunity to beg your leave to make a new Preſent to you of that fidelity and ſervice, I devoted to you from the firſt minute I beheld you. The veneration, ſaid <hi>Cytheris,</hi> which you interpret to be ſo favourable to you, includes more than one conſideration; and if that which
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94435:110"/> chac'd me out of <hi>Rome,</hi> flatters your deſires; that which fixes me to a due reſentment of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Commands, forbids me to accept the faith of a <hi>Roman.</hi> You have made too admir'd a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, Madam, ſaid I, in the School of Science, to be ignorant, that ſuch reſentments are unjuſt. Hate the memory of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who, in giving that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal wound to the King your Grandfather, gave the firſt to your diſhonor: Hate the name of <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> who in conquering the <hi>Gaules,</hi> depriv'd you of the ſuccor of all your Allies. But what Crime have I perpetrated? I that was not in being, when thoſe Wars began, &amp; who have ever ador'd you with a moſt pure and ardent Paſſion? This Paſſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Cytheris,</hi> cannot work a Miracle, and make you no <hi>Roman,</hi> nor me not a Princeſs of the <hi>Gaules;</hi> theſe two qualifications include a formal contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to all your deſires. The ſame contempt your Senate affects for the alliance of Queens, do I harbor for all that is not of a Blood Royal. The contempt you harbor, anſwer'd I, ought now to be extinct, in all the Nations of the earth. For as now there are none, that do not acknowledge the Power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles, there are none, that have not eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Maxims of their Empire, and we ſee more Kings ſollicite now for the honor of her Adoption, than we ſaw before diſpute her Sovereignty. Thoſe Kings did not deſcend from <hi>Viridomare,</hi> ſaid <hi>Cythe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> if they had, they would have held their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Honor more ſacred. And if you deſire from me a ſincere declaration of my thoughts, I have alwayes had an eſteem for your perſon; I am not inſenſible of the proofs and marks of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and but too ſenſible of the deſpicable ſtate, to which Fortune has reduc'd me, to fanſie my ſelf
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:94435:110"/> in a capacity to reject the meaneſt dignity; yet Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Blood can never forget the channel from whence it flows; and I ſhould diſdain the Nephew of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> himſelf, ſhould he be offer'd me, under the title of a ſimple Citizen.</p>
               <p>Theſe words, were ſo many mortal wounds, both to my Fortune, and my Reaſon; and though <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theris</hi> pronounc'd them, to no other end, than to extinguiſh my ambitious hopes, yet I imagin'd they taught me the infallible way to triumph over her. I caus'd my ſelf to be ſerv'd in the ſame ſtate, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the ancient Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> had been; I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd their Habit, I commanded my Statue to be erected in divers places of the City, and in fine, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all thoſe Follies, which have ſo juſtly irritated <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s indignation againſt me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cytheris</hi> beheld the firſt Sallies of my extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with grief, and employ'd all her power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them. But the firſt error was ſucceeded by a ſecond. I ſaw her ſo ſenſible of the danger, into which I precipitated my ſelf, that I hop'd ſhe would endeavor its prevention, by favoring my deſires: and intoxicated with this frenzy, I gave an effuſe rein to my criminal audacities. <hi>Cytheris</hi> obſerving how I daily run from one extravagancy into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was willing, I ſuppoſe, to ſtop the mouth of all cenſures, that might impeach her, of having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to them; and ſo ſtole one night privately away with <hi>Phila,</hi> and left me plung'd into the deepeſt abyſs of deſpair.</p>
               <p>I demanded her from thoſe that could not reſtore her, and threatned ſuch as I ſuſpected, had convey'd her away. I employ'd in her queſt that diligence and authority, <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf would not have made uſe of, but on ſome ſpecial occaſion for the ſervice
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:94435:111"/> of the Empire; I exercis'd unjuſt cruelties upon ſuch, as I ſent after her, and did not bring her back to me. What ſhall I expreſs more to you, my dear <hi>Virgil?</hi> I lov'd even to diſtraction, and I have loſt for ever the glorious object of my hopes. My paſſion is not unknown to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and perhaps when he ſhall underſtand by <hi>Terentia,</hi> that Love alone has been the Author of my Offences, he may grant it a Pardon, for what a formal and deſign'd Rebellion could not expect one.</p>
               <p>The end of <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Relation, had brought them juſt to the Gates of <hi>Tuſculum;</hi> where he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately ſollicited <hi>Virgil</hi> to acquaint him with the cauſe of that tranſport he had obſerv'd in him, when he nam'd <hi>Phila</hi> in his diſcourſe. But ſuch important Concerns occur to us in <hi>Rome,</hi> that they ſummon us thither; and we muſt awhile defer to make it appear, that <hi>Virgil</hi> did not diſcourſe of Love with ſuch eloquence, without having had ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of its effects.</p>

                  <hi>Mecoenas</hi> was extremely ſurpriz'd with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; The Emperor had not told him any thing poſitively of <hi>Craſſus</hi>'s Love for <hi>Terentia,</hi> doubting he might have too jealous an apprehenſion for the Concern he ſhould expreſs for it, but had made only ſome ſlight reflections upon the circumſtances of the Combat betwixt him and <hi>Ovid.</hi>

               <p>He chang'd colour, when through the indiſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> he came to underſtand, that either <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> had been miſinform'd, or deluded his credulous ſincerity. And not knowing on the ſudden how

               <p>I ſhall not entertain you, with the repetition of the firſt beginnings of my Love, which is as ancient, as my Reaſon, and has been devoted to <hi>Terentia</hi> from the firſt moment my eyes, or it, were capable of being Judges of Beauty: but my Admiration never took its juſt Meaſures, till at the Marriage of <hi>Domitius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You remember, doubtleſs, that it was celebrated at <hi>Preneſte,</hi> where the Emperor treated the whole Court three dayes together: you withdrew your ſelf one evening from the reſt of the Company, and came to take the Air with <hi>Terentia</hi> into a Garden, where, of one of the cloſeſt Walks I was poſſeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Arrival, I did not underſtand your firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,

               <p>You do me wrong, I never lov'd you more, than at this preſent; but do you not know that all things have their ſeaſon? This, too day, is juſtly due to the viſible tranſports of <hi>Domitius:</hi> and he would commit an offence both againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and common cuſtom, ſhould he on the day of his Marriage with the Daughter of <hi>Octavia,</hi> expreſs a coldneſs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency. A few dayes hence the ſame cuſtom will oblige him to another deportment, not but that he might be the Maſter hereafter of as much real Love, as at the preſent, but he could not again have the ſame opportunity to ſignalize and applaud the manifeſtation of it; And nothing is more ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the eyes of indifferent Perſons, than to ſee a Husband, who might command all ſeaſons to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his kindneſs to his Wife, affect to make choice of the Publick. Why this Policy, and why theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, ſaid <hi>Terentia,</hi> interrupting him; Is Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Love a Monſter? And is it not a Crime that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the loudeſt reproach, to ſee a Husband draw a Curtain betwixt the eyes of the World, and his kindneſs for his Wife, and open it to let in that of anothers? And ought that Love, which both Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Honor render legitimate, to be more ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd, than that which both Honor and Heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to be impudent?

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:94435:114"/> your Arguments eſcap'd my memory; and the next day I fram'd a Dialogue in Verſe, which I intituled, THE J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>STIFIY'D WIFE; wherein I demonſtrated, that the tepidity of Husbands did au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize and juſtifie the levity and infidelity of their Wives towards them. I never pretended to a Talent in writing, but that of Poetry, is one of the firſt Miracles, Love works in us. <hi>Terentia</hi> finding theſe Verſes in one of her Pockets, into which I had privately convey'd them, and reflecting that <hi>Ovid</hi> had the day before ſuſtain'd the ſame Maxims at <hi>Sulpicia</hi>'s, conceited him to be the Author of them. She found him at the Princeſs <hi>Julia</hi>'s Apartment, whither I had the honor to wait upon her; where ſhe told him railingly, that he was formidable enough to Husbands in the merit of his own Perſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the addition of his poyſonous Maxims. <hi>Ovid,</hi> who call'd to mind the late converſation he held at <hi>Sulpicia</hi>'s, was oblig'd to make a direct Anſwer to <hi>Terentia</hi>'s imputation: which, the more it was preſt upon him, the greater confuſion it involv'd him in: For the ſame Morning he had ſent <hi>Sulpicia</hi> a Copy of Verſes on the ſame Subject. And thinking that ſhe had lent them to <hi>Terentia,</hi> ſatisfy'd himſelf to tell her pleaſantly, that he was glad to ſee Ladies applaud Lovers in the method of their Addreſſes. This own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Work, which I thought <hi>Ovid</hi> was oblig'd to deny, fill'd me with indignation. May a Man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, Madam, ſaid I to <hi>Terentia,</hi> to beg a ſight of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Maxims? I am yet but a Novice in the Art of Perſuaſion, and ſhould be happy to receive the firſt Rudiments of that glorious Science, from ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a Maſter. Let <hi>Ovid,</hi> ſaid <hi>Terentia</hi> interrupting me, give you what inſtructions he pleaſes; but you muſt excuſe me, if you receive them not from my
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:94435:115"/> hands; and I have put my ſelf out of a capacity of committing the obligation you deſire; for I have committed the Verſes already to flames, you beg the ſight of. You muſt give me leave, Madam, reply'd <hi>Ovid,</hi> to doubt the reality of what you expreſs; for had you deſtin'd them to that puniſhment, you would have inflicted another upon your ſelf, which was not to divulge it; and one is ſeldom guilty of burning that, which he religiouſly cheriſhes in his thoughts and memory.</p>
               <p>This converſation was urg'd ſo far, and its intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate obſcurity found my ſpirit ſo ill diſpos'd, that it extracted poyſon out of every flower of it. I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd <hi>Ovid</hi> was my Rival; and that he had prevented me in my deſign of perſuading <hi>Terentia</hi> to turn a fair Rebel to conjugal Sovereignty. A thouſand actions, which till then I regarded with an eye of indifferency, and in effect were no other, now repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves to me in another ſhape. <hi>Ovid</hi> could not exhibit her the leaſt teſtimony of a reſpect, which I did not interpret as a teſtimony of Love: nor could ſhe allow him a favourable word, which I did not conſtrue for a remarkable favor, one day in the grand Cirque he drop'd a piece of a Letter, which I catch'd up; wherein I imagin'd I read that, which certainly was not there, I could not diſguiſe the rage this error ingrafted in my jealous thoughts. I became his oppoſite in all things; I ſpoke as little good of him, as ill will could afford: And when I raillied him, I did it with that vehemency and roughneſs, which fail'd but little ſometimes of being the rude Uſhers of a quarrel. <hi>Terentia</hi> took notice of it; and one day coming forth of the Empreſſes Apartment, as I was leading her to her Chariot, Are you, ſaid ſhe to me, <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Rival? Or is there ſome
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:94435:115"/> other cauſe for the animoſity, I obſerve, you have, for him? You pike him upon things the moſt indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; and alwayes make your contradictions, the anſwer to all his aſſertions. I beg your pardon, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid I, there is one aſſertion I never yet durſt contradict, and we both agree that you are the moſt glorious beauty of the Univerſe. It was not a piece of Gallantry, I demanded of you, reply'd <hi>Terentia,</hi> but the cauſe of your conteſts with <hi>Ovid.</hi> You have divin'd it, Madam, ſaid I, we are Rivals. And may one make ſo bold, as to ask, reply'd <hi>Terentia,</hi> who this beauty is, that is worthy to be the object of ſo noble a Rivalſhip? The moſt glorious of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, Madam, ſaid I. This phraſe is familiar to all Lovers, anſwer'd your beautiful Spouſe, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade themſelves, that the common opinion ought to be led in triumph after theirs; and aſcribe the higheſt attributes of beauty, to that, which they Idolize in their own imaginations. But that I may be the more capable of judging, whether your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs does really merit that title, or whether you do not take a proſpect of her perfections through the optick of fancy only, I pray acquaint me with her name. I have nam'd her already, Madam, ſaid I; and the diſtinction I made of that, wherein I agreed or diſagreed with <hi>Ovid,</hi> has imparted you the whole ſecret. <hi>Terentia</hi> had a piercing judgment and my lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing regards were no fit Sophiſters, to delude it, She on a ſudden eclips'd the luſtre of thoſe divine looks with a frown, which as often yet as I think upon it, darts a horror thorow all my veins; and briskly mounting into her Chariot, left me in ſuch an agony and confuſion, that I had not the power to move out of the place. You came a little after, and ſurprized me in my extaſie: and ſeeing me in that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:94435:116"/> poſture, leaning againſt a Pillar, my countenance changed, and my body almoſt as immoveable as the Marble, that ſupported me. You did me the honor to ask me, what it was, that had reduc'd me to that condition. I know not what anſwer I made you, but it was doubtleſs a very extravagant one; for you preſently burſt forth into a loud laughter, and ask'd of ſome perſons about you, if you had not the Mine of a very cruel Lady. Theſe words recall'd my reaſon; and fearing I had inconſiderately divulg'd the whole ſecret, I follow'd you towards the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Lodgings, with an intent, if poſſible, to repair ſo dangerous a fault: when I ſoon perceiv'd by the air of your countenance, that you had not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd it. You began to raillie me with a liberty, you could not have diſpens'd with, had my indiſcretion betray'd my offence to you, and in obliging terms begging the honor, that I would make you my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, you made me a tender of your faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Alas! I had need enough of it; for never Lover was treated with ſuch rigor, as I experienc'd from the incomparable <hi>Terentia:</hi> She intercepted from me all opportunities of ſpeaking to her; ſhe avoided all occaſions of giving me her hand. I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd her to the Temples, to the Gardens, to the Empreſſes, to the Princeſſes Apartments. I could not ſurprize one regard from her; and if at any time forgetting herſelf, ſhe ſo much relax'd of her ſeverity, as to ſuffer her eyes to beſtow a glance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, ſhe would dart ſuch flaſhes of indignation and diſdain from them into mine, that now the beſt of my hopes wander'd but like wild Borderers, on the brinks of deſpair. <hi>Phedra</hi> perceiv'd the viſible marks of it, and gave me to underſtand, they had not eſcap'd her curioſity. She would put her hand
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:94435:116"/> before my eyes, when ſhe ſaw them too intentively fix'd upon her fair Miſtriſs. She would ſpeak things before me, which I might apply, as counſels to my ſelf. One night <hi>Terentia</hi> having loſt at the Princeſs <hi>Octavia</hi>'s Lodgings a Diamond-button, which her train hung in; Reſtore it, if you have it, ſaid <hi>Phedro</hi> to me in my ear; every thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to <hi>Terentia,</hi> participates of the Magick of her eyes; and you need not add another doſe, to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of their powerful charms. Theſe overtures of an ingenuous confidence, engag'd mine. I was one day in the Temple of <hi>Concordia,</hi> where your fair Spouſe did offer Sacrifice. <hi>Phedra,</hi> who attended her, pretending that the Sun incommoded her, came and plac'd herſelf by me, and ask'd me ſoftly, If I were come thither to ſupplicate the Goddeſs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the difference which was betwixt my heart and my reaſon. They are not at variance, ſaid I: And my reaſon is ſo far from controuling the deſires of my hear, that it daily more and more convinces me, that the glorious <hi>Terentia</hi> is the onely perſon in the world, worthy of its Adorations. Theſe are glorious words, reply'd <hi>Phedra</hi> with a ſmile; but amongſt perſons of ſound judgment, they weigh but little. When a Love diſquiets the repoſe, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the countenance, and may, perhaps, ruine the Fortune of a Man, Reaſon does not approve it. Alas! How <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Ovid</hi> is ignorant of none of this, ſaid I interrupting her, and yet he preſumes to love <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi> and, if I am not deceiv'd, is not hated by her. <hi>Ovid?</hi> reply'd <hi>Phedra,</hi> ſurpriz'd with a ſeeming aſtoniſhment. I, <hi>Ovid,</hi> ſaid I, Lovers are linx-ey'd; and the felicity of that Rival may triumph over my
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:94435:117"/> ſtars, but not my knowlege: It is for him, that I am deſpis'd; it is to him, that my deſpair is ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd.</p>
               <p>I could not proceed any farther in my complaints, the Ceremony ended, and <hi>Phedra</hi> was oblig'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>Terentia;</hi> but I retriev'd her again the ſame evening upon the banks of <hi>Tyber,</hi> where the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and the whole Court, were diverting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the benefit of the freſh air.</p>
               <p>Your jealouſie is not without reaſon, ſaid ſhe to me, as ſoon as I approach'd her. <hi>Ovid</hi> is belov'd of <hi>Terentia,</hi> and this obſtacle will accompany all others, your Love ſhall encounter. I thought this morning to have acquianted you with ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but ſince you could reap no advantage by them, I forbore to mention them: ſerve your ſelf of this, I now offer you; and handle it, as the moſt uſeful weapon, to vanquiſh your Paſſion. Vanquiſh it! ſaid I, Oh? <hi>Phedra,</hi> it is invincible. I have not delay'd till now, I have long ſince ſummoned all my Forces together to combat it; there is nothing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other could ſay to me, which I have not ſaid to my ſelf. But after a thouſand attempts, a thouſand ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects upon my ſelf, one look, one word, one thought of <hi>Terentia,</hi> has in an inſtant baffled all my ſtrongeſt reſolutions. And I find, that the Gods have given me a Soul to no other end, than to make it her Slave and Vaſſal to the laſt moment of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Has <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> then, ſaid <hi>Phedra,</hi> ingroſs'd to herſelf alone all the charms of her Sex! She has beauty; and he that ſhould deny it, would forfeit his reaſon: But do you think, that agreeableneſs of humor, vivacity of wit, and gayety of converſe, are to be found in none of the Sex but her? I know not, ſaid I, what may be found in another, but in <hi>Terentia</hi> alone my
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:94435:117"/> heart expects to find its intire repoſe and felicity. Aſſiſt it, generous <hi>Phedra,</hi> aſſiſt it, to atchieve it, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I, preſſing her hand tenderly betwixt mine; you have both addreſs and credit, employ them, I, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, to ſave the life of an unfortunate, wretch, who reſigns himſelf up wholly to the auſpiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your conduct. All that I ſue for at the Shrine of that adorable Deity, is only a permiſſion to Love, and to declare it. Let her confine this Love to the moſt ſcrupulous terms, the narroweſt bounds, rigor can invent. Let it lie and languiſh at her feet in vain, after the meaneſt favors; it ſhall conſent to any thing, ſo it may be licens'd only to own it ſelf before her. Is this a grace of too high a merit, to be implor'd? And muſt I deſpair ever to obtain it?</p>
               <p>I obſerv'd that <hi>Phedra</hi> chang'd colour oftentimes during my diſcourſe, which at this place ſhe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with a deep ſigh, and not able to ſuppreſs ſome rebellious tears, which againſt her conſent ſtarted in a ſhowr of Pearls out of her eyes; you are an Ingrate, ſaid ſhe to me, with a voice quite al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from its ordinary accent; and you might have perceiv'd, how improper a perſon I am for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy you deſign me.

Recall to your memory my words and my actions; take a re-ſurvey of my languiſhing eyes, and my diſtracted countenance; and reflecting with ſhame upon your paſt inſenſibility, employ me no more, but in what you may oblige me, as I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor'd to oblige you.</p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:94435:118"/>
               <p>How? cry'd <hi>Mecoenas</hi> aloud, was it <hi>Phedra</hi> that made you theſe forward overtures of Love? do you not miſname her for another? and may I give an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire credit to your words?</p>
               <p>Reſerve your admiration, my Lord, ſaid <hi>Craſſus,</hi> for its due ſeaſon and place; you are not yet arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to that, which ought more juſtly to challenge your exclamations. Theſe aſtoniſhing expreſſions, which I could not in reaſon be accus'd for not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing, ſurpriz'd me with ſo much confuſion, that it imprinted its lively effects in <hi>Phedra</hi>'s cheeks, who obſerv'd it in mine.</p>
               <p>She left me with eyes inflam'd with ſhame and deſpite too, as I imagin'd; and adding herſelf to the company of ſome Ladies of the Empreſſes train, abandon'd me to the liberty of ruminating upon my adventure: which I conſider'd as environ'd with ſo many perplexities and dangers, that I knew not what courſe to ſteer, to avoid the rocks that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my ſhipwrack. I was not ignorant either of the credit, <hi>Phedra</hi> held in your Family, or what a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous <hi>ſpecies</hi> of fury, a Womans malice, that ſees her Love deſpis'd, does ſwell to. I apprehended ſome funeſt effect of her revenge; and yet I was neither capable to entertain, or counterfeit a paſſion, that might ſecure me from it: Theſe various reflections did for four or five days tyrannize over my diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soul. And ſeeing <hi>Terentia</hi>'s cruelty and diſdain daily increaſe, I had a deſire to try, if abſence might not prove a cure, or at leaſt an antidote, againſt ſo many contagious evils. This deſign was no ſooner fram'd, but aſſaulted on all ſides with mournful ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, doubts, and incertitudes. My reaſon had no ſooner ſaid, I will, but my heart anſwer'd, I will not. I could harbor no reſt in my eyes, no quiet in
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:94435:118"/> my breaſt: But reaſon at length triumph'd over ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolution, and I gave the neceſſary Orders for my departure; when, as I was going to beg the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors leave to accompany <hi>Lentulus</hi> to the <hi>Getiſh</hi> War, a Mooriſh Slave, who I knew belong'd to <hi>Phedra,</hi> came and deliver'd me a Billet from her. I imagin'd it had been fraught with new and troubleſom declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her Paſſion; and not willing to anſwer it, I thought to have return'd it, without reading: But a conſideration of the reſpect which was due to a perſon of <hi>Phedra</hi>'s Sex, qualifying all others, I open'd it, and found theſe Lines.
<q>Will you go, you too hard-hearted, and too charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ingrate? Is neither the conſideration of my tender paſſion of the pleaſures it is capable to afford you, nor that of my death, which ſhall certainly follow you, able to divert your ſullen reſolutions? Alas!

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:94435:119"/> be guilty of a grand untruth, ſhould I flatter you with the hopes of ſuch a Miracle: But I aſſure you of a friendſhip ſo pure and ſo tender, that were there a veil drawn before the ſecrets of my heart, you would miſtake it for Love. The amorous heats of perſons of my age, are generally, like Paſſengers, fix'd no where; and draw after them a train of more real diſcontents, than pleaſures. Let you and I combine our hearts in the ſolid link of a more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable union. You ſhall ever be the object of my whole eſteem, and honor me alwayes with yours. This is the only Love, which is neither ſubject to diſcontent, or change. <hi>Phedra</hi> bluſh'd, and with her languiſhing eyes ſeem'd to beg another kind of union; but again confirm'd the promiſes, ſhe had made me in the Ticket ſhe ſent me, and I had a few dayes after ſome ground to believe, that ſhe was juſt both to them, and me.</p>
               <p>I found <hi>Terentia</hi>'s eyes diſarm'd of their flaming darts; ſhe ſuffer'd me to pay my attendance on her in the Gardens of <hi>Lucullus:</hi> ſhe addreſs'd ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to me, which though it treated only of things indifferent, did tranſport me beyond my ſelf with joy and content. What Miracles have you wrought already? My dear <hi>Phedra,</hi> ſaid I, when I had the opportunity to diſcourſe her in private: The Gods have bleſt your generous deſigns, and the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate rigor of <hi>Terentia,</hi> is not able to hold out a two dayes ſiege againſt your batteries. What am I able to perform, that may merit a ſervice of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance? Do not intercept from me the means of continuing it, reply'd <hi>Phedra;</hi> you were never yet well acquainted with the humor of <hi>Terentia;</hi> it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes as many Myſteries, as her Perſon Beauties: you muſt diſcover nothing to her, but give her leave
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:94435:119"/> to conjecture your intentions. And this was the track, by which <hi>Ovid</hi> arriv'd at that favor, he aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red too: which you muſt likewiſe take, if you hope to attain to it: Let your Love employ all its facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but its tongue, and leave to me the care of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting your ſilence not to your diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>This counſel was the more difficult for me to obey, in regard <hi>Terentia</hi> re-aſſuming her former frankneſs and gayety of humor in converſing with me, furniſh'd me with a thouſand occaſions of breaking the uneaſie bonds of my impoſed ſilence. But <hi>Phedra,</hi> whoſe eyes were two watchful Spies over me, diſappointed them all. She would caſt terrible frowns at me; ſhe would interrupt me, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a bare apprehenſion, that I was going to give my tongue liberty to diſcover my thoughts; and never ſuffering me to be the Maſter of my own conduct, would force me to obſerve the Laws ſhe had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd me, maugre all my attempts to violate them.</p>
               <p>I fram'd a complaint one day of the violence ſhe offer'd me in a paſſionate Letter to <hi>Terentia,</hi> which I deliver'd to <hi>Phedra</hi> for her, which ſhe aſſur'd me ſhe had oblig'd her to read; I ſeconded that with another, to which I receiv'd a Billet of three or four lines in anſwer. <hi>Phedra</hi> promis'd me, that in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time ſhe would effect greater things for me. And a little after, a Ticket was directed to me, which ſummon'd me to a nocturnal aſſignation. <hi>Phedra</hi> brought it, and when I had read it, Well, ſaid ſhe, have I not now, think you, dearly purchas'd your ſtay in <hi>Rome?</hi> And do you not comprehend, that at the rate I have bought it, how precious a value I have for it? I never yet doubted your goodneſs, my
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:94435:120"/> dear <hi>Phedra,</hi> anſwer'd I; and I conjure you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there are no acknowledgments within my power, which I ſhall not ſacrifice to it. Diſpoſe of my life and fortune; exact the ſtrongeſt proof ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable from a friendſhip, which ambitions nothing more, than ſo glorious a teſt. But, my Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd ſhe, interrupting me with a languiſhing look, do you think that this friendſhip, as perfect as you decipher it, is capable to enable me to ſerve you, as I do, with tranquility and repoſe? You employ my diligence, you require convincing proofs of it; and from my hand you receive an aſſignation, from her you adore; what could your revenge, or your ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, commit more barbarous, or more cruel? My dear <hi>Phedra,</hi> ſaid I, ſenſibly touch'd with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, Would Heaven had given me the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of my heart, as it has given you of yours, I ſhould then have ſacrific'd it to the ſame Deity you do. But alas! I am an unfortunate wretch, who has no power left him, but to fill your ears with complaints againſt the ſeverity of his deſtiny; to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign himſelf before you of ingratitude, and offer up his life too, if you require it, in expiation of his crime. You offer but little, reply'd <hi>Phedra,</hi> with a ſigh, in offering ſo much; and you are aſſur'd, that your life is but in ſmall danger, if that be the onely ſacrifice you intend to offer to the Deity you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>In ſaying this, ſhe led me to the Cypreſs Walk; into one end whereof, there is a private deſcent by a back pair of Stairs out of <hi>Terentia's</hi> Cloſet. She told me, that when you were gone at night to wait upon the Emperor in his Bed-chamber, one ſhould come for me, when ſhe left me; and by the Stairs I nam'd, conduct me to the Room, where <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:94435:120"/> ſhould honor me with the interview, I ſo much deſir'd.</p>
               <p>Do not diſturb your ſelf, my Lord, ſaid <hi>Craſſus,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Mecoenas</hi> change colour; for nothing was perform'd, of what was promiſed. I ſtood Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel two long hours at the foot of a Cypreſs Tree; the leaſt motion whereof, made me ſhake, like the trembling leaves over my head, and ſtruck a panic terror into my Soul: when at length there came one to me, and told me, that you were engag'd at Play with Prince <hi>Marcellus;</hi> that you did not go that night to wait upon the Emperor, and that our Aſſignment was to be adjourned to the next day. I laid a thouſand imprecations upon the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of Gaming, and the practice of it. I threw as many more at my Stars, and went raving towards the place, where you were at play, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at leaſt to purchaſe a view of <hi>Terentia</hi> in publick, which was deny'd me in private. This expectation was no more ſucceſsful, than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. <hi>Terentia</hi> was retir'd, and I was ſcarce en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, when one of her Slaves came, and whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ovid</hi> aſide, who was looking upon the Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, conducted him to her Ladies Chamber.</p>
               <p>I am well acquainted with all the tranſactions of that night, reply'd <hi>Mecoenas;</hi> and if you take your meaſures from thence, your ſuſpitions are chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical, and you ought to efface them out of your thoughts.</p>
               <p>They are effac'd already, my Lord, ſaid <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and I am as well ſatisfi'd at the preſent, as your ſelf, touching the deſign for which <hi>Terentia</hi> ſent that night for <hi>Ovid;</hi> but I was then ignorant of it; and only apprehended, that he was favour'd with the Aſſignation, which was promiſed me:
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:94435:121"/> that the appointment was broken with me, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend him; and that my juſt reſentments of ſo inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane an affront was deſign'd only to advance the triumph of my Rival. I went to ſeek out <hi>Phedra,</hi> to make my complaint to her; but I could find her neither in her own Chamber, nor in any of her Companions; I thought ſhe might have been gone into the Garden, to look after me, and advertiſe me of what had fallen out. I haſtened thither, after I had made many turns in vain about it, at laſt I perceiv'd <hi>Ovid</hi> deſcending by thoſe Stairs, which I had been told, was the private Road of favour'd Lovers.</p>
               <p>Can you wonder, my Lord, if I retain'd not the leaſt ſpark of ſound judgment or reaſon, in a circumſtance ſo capable to deprive me of it; and if I endeavour'd to revenge upon <hi>Ovid,</hi> a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, which I could not call <hi>Terentia</hi> to an account for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phedra</hi> writ to me the next morning, and highly blaming me for the rude alarm, I had given her Ladies honor, aſſur'd me that it would utterly ruine me in her good opinion; and that I ſhould deſpair hereafter of ever receiving the leaſt favor from her: Did it not become me, either to caſt out Complaints, or Menaces? That a real Love was always attended with a zealous fear and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. I ran to <hi>Phedra's</hi> Chamber, to conjure her either to obtain a pardon for me, or a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death: She was gone to <hi>Helvidia's,</hi> and her Mooriſh Slave left me in hers, whilſt ſhe went to call her. I was not then in an humor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude either my time or thoughts, with the ſearch after Curioſities; but, I know not what ſecret im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe mov'd me to caſt my eyes upon an Eſcritoire,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:94435:121"/> which ſtood open by me; I examin'd it, and found in it a Letter, which at the firſt ſight, I imagin'd to be <hi>Terentia's</hi> writing. I opened it: But my Lord, How great was my aſtoniſhment, when by the Stile, and the Subſcription, I found it to be <hi>Phedra's.</hi> She gave therein an account of a Suit the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had then depending at Court, which I knew, had been recommended to her. She magnifi'd it in the favors you honor'd her with, her credit, her expectations; and in fine, gave her ſelf ſo natural a character, that I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known her before, but through a diſguiſe. I pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Ticket and Letter out of my Pocket, which I imagin'd <hi>Terentia</hi> had ſent me, I compar'd it with that I had in my hand. The Writing was much like; and to evince all my ſcruples, I found in the ſame Cabinet, an Order to <hi>Phedra,</hi> written with your Wives own hand, which ſpoke in the language of a Miſtreſs to a Servant, and convinc'd me by the difference of the Character, that it was none but <hi>Phedra,</hi> who had written to me. What a Thunder-clap was this to a man, who was totally abſorpt in a deluge of Love, and believed himſef to be fixt in his Miſtreſſes favor. Oh! <hi>Phedra,</hi> cry'd I, as ſoon as I ſaw her enter, you have trepan'd me, by a horrid act of treachery. See here irrefragable teſtimonies to caſt you; that under a pretence of an unfeigned Paſſion, which you ſuborn'd to delude me, have expos'd my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity to the rude treats of your Malice.</p>
               <p>I was able to ſay no more to her; for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion I ſaw her in, had converted all my ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into certitude; which rais'd mine own to ſuch an height, that it even conglutinated my Tongue to the Palate of my Mouth. When the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:94435:122"/> firſt pangs of this Agony were paſt, and from a Marble Pillar that propt me up, I caſt a glance upon the eyes of <hi>Phedra,</hi> which by the torrent of their tears, and their dejected baſhfulneſs, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sentence of my misfortune; Falſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful <hi>Phedra,</hi> ſaid I to her, outrag'd with grief, What inhumane crime am I guilty of towards you, that you ſhould reduce me to the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſtate, that humanity it ſelf was ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to groan vnder? Was I culpable, becauſe your eyes thought me charming? Did I abuſe your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility? Did I encourage your paſſion, or expoſe it to publick ſcorn? In fine, What barbariſm have I committed, that could induce you to commit ſo many Treaſons againſt me? You would have left me, reply'd ſhe, and I had not reſolution enough to ſupport your abſence. I borrow'd the credit of <hi>Terentia,</hi> where I ſaw mine own inſufficient. The inviſible Powers above, are my Witneſſes, that I have not been wanting to any one particular of thoſe devoirs, I engag'd to you; and that repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the impulſe of my own forcible inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I would have ſacrific'd them to your felicity, had it center'd in me. But <hi>Terentia</hi> was inexor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and you reſolv'd to leave <hi>Rome:</hi> What could an unfortunate Woman do? who, influenc'd by the fatality of her Stars, regarded your abſence as the moſt cruel of all torments. But, ſaid I, <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia's</hi> rigor is mollifyed, ſhe speaks to me, and denies me no marks of a viſible eſteem. To what Magick, or Fancy, do I owe this? To a Fancy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Phedra,</hi> I have ſuggeſted to her, that you had withdrawn your love, and rendring your ſelf to my importunities, addreſt thoſe Vows to me, which were ſo diſpleaſing to her. And I my ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:94435:122"/> the vain hope to induce you one day to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſo chimerical a change. I flattered my ſelf with the thoughts of obtaining that by a ſenſe of gratitude and compaſſion, which your inclination could not grant me; and to gain time to accompliſh my deſign, I made uſe of the dexterity, I have, in writing two different hands. And ſeeing the more Sacrifice my Love offered to you, the leſs ſenſible you were of it, I reſolv'd to owe that to a Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, which I could arrive to by no other means. I would have ſupply'd the place of <hi>Terentia,</hi> at the appointed Aſſignation, and in order to it, had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed all things for the beſt advantage to deceive you. I would have ſpoken to you from within a Glaſs Alcove; from which you ſhould have been plac'd at ſuch a diſtance, that you ſhould not have been ſenſible of the cheat. But Love, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Love, deny'd me even that imaginary ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, of raiſing your tranſports under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another. For <hi>Terentia</hi> had cloyſter'd her ſelf up all the time in that unlucky Cloſet, which I had deſign'd for our Converſe. What ſeverer puniſhment could you wiſh Heaven to inflict up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, than that whereof I my ſelf am the fatal Inſtrument? I love, without hopes of being lov'd again. I have betray'd the confidence of a Lady, which has highly oblig'd me. I have hazarded her reputatition, the honor of <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> your own life and fortune. And I have purchas'd nothing in compenſation of ſo many Crimes, but the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of being loathſome and odious to you. Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el one! can you ſo much forget Man, and receive a Tyger in your Boſom, as to object to me yet your unworthy reproaches? And is the antipathy, you have conceiv'd againſt me, ſo inveterate, that the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:94435:123"/> ſence of my ſufferings will never be able to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it? I ſcarce heard theſe laſt paſſionate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, for I turn'd haſtily away from her, to go ſeek out <hi>Terentia:</hi> and imagining that nothing could be of more tragical conſequence to me, than the errors, <hi>Phedra</hi> had treacherouſly involv'd her in, I would have run all hazards, to have diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her of it. But ſince my encounter with <hi>Ovid,</hi> ſhe has always ſo ſedulouſly addicted her ſelf to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to calm his indignation, that I could never gain a moments time to entertain her, I judge that <hi>Phedra</hi> has not neglected, that, that I allow'd her; and conſidering, what an opportunity, I had to ruine her, has prevented me. But, my Lord, let her not triumph over my misfortune, and in her glorious Treaſon. Alas! without its artifice, I had deſign'd to remove my ſelf from <hi>Terentia's</hi> preſence; and to go into the Field, and there op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the effeminate attacks of <hi>Venus</hi> with the rough Arms of <hi>Bellona;</hi> nor ever to ſee <hi>Rome</hi> more, till <hi>Mars</hi> had been my Phyſitian, and cur'd my diſtemper. But the fraudulent <hi>Phedra</hi> has tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed my deſign; and to ſatisfie the fancy of her capricious Love, which her Reaſon ought to have ſurmounted, gave the occaſion of that tumult and diſorder, you ſaw the Court in. It was ſhe, who by fomenting my jealouſie againſt <hi>Ovid,</hi> was the inſtrument of that great Perſons baniſhment. But time has at length convinc'd me, that my ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were groundleſs, and that <hi>Phedra</hi> did only raiſe them, to be an obſtacle to my Paſſion: But had they not been unfortunately confin'd by my encountring <hi>Ovid</hi> in the Garden, that Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage might have been at this hour in <hi>Rome; Caeſar</hi> free from all reſentments of jealouſie, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94435:123"/> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> in repoſe; and you, your ſelf, my Lord, ignorant perhaps of the ſecret deſigns, I form'd, to attack the Royal Fort of <hi>Terentia</hi>'s heart. Guard your ſelf from a fury ſo fertile in fatal inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and aſſuring your ſelf, that ſhe may act one day as much againſt your intereſt, as you ſee, ſhe has done of late againſt mine, preſerve <hi>Terentia</hi> and your ſelf from the Artifices of ſo deluding a Sorcereſs.</p>
               <p>This diſcovery and preadmonition had already produc'd the moſt cruel effects in the heart of <hi>Mecoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> as it was capable to comprehend. He paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected <hi>Phedra;</hi> and his Love was the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, in that he conceal'd it as a ſecret, from the eyes of the world. He reſented with an incredible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction, the injury his Paſſion had receiv'd from the ingratitude of this falſe one. And more enrag'd againſt <hi>Craſſus,</hi> for the innocent attempt he had made upon the heart of his Miſtriſs, than the criminal one he had form'd againſt that of his Wife, he executed <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Orders with a rigor not ſutable to the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his natural temper. <hi>Craſſus</hi> was aſtoniſh'd, and could not forbear to tell him, that he ought ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to treat him with leſs mildneſs, or execute his Commiſſion with leſs authority. <hi>Mecoenas</hi> would not vouchſafe to return him an anſwer; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that <hi>Phedra</hi> had not accompany'd <hi>Terentia</hi> to <hi>Tullia</hi>'s <hi>Villa,</hi> he ran, tranſported with jealouſie, towards the Chamber of that ungrateful one; but was intercepted by the way by the Philoſopher <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnius,</hi> who was a Man in high reputation for his learning and wiſdom, and in particular eſteem with <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> whom he acquainted, that he was come not only to wait upon him, but likewiſe to entertain him with a Novelty of importance. They retir'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into a Cloſet, and when they were alone, what
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94435:124"/> an Age do we live in? My Lord, ſaid the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, the debauchery of Wit and Manners, triumphs over all Laws, contemns the counſels and advice of wiſdom, and converts into tears of compaſſion the unregarded documents of Prudence. <hi>Ovid,</hi> who has receiv'd ſo many graces both from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and you; <hi>Ovid</hi> ſo capable of all excellent notions and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if he would apply himſelf to them; <hi>Ovid,</hi> in a word, to whom I have been ſo prodigal of my rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt inſtructions, has betray'd both Natures deſigns, and mine. Behold here, my Lord the Legacy he bequeath'd me ſome few dayes before his <hi>Thalaſſian</hi> journey, and baniſhing all ſpirits of this character from the Court, acquit your ſelf with honor of the truſt, <hi>Caeſar</hi> has repos'd in yours. Finiſhing theſe words, he put into <hi>Mecoenas</hi>'s hand a little Cabinet of Cedar, which <hi>Ovid,</hi> coming from <hi>Domitius</hi>'s houſe had left behind him, rather through oblivion, than deſign of his. <hi>Mecoenas</hi> open'd it, and the firſt Paper that came to his hand, contain'd the following Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

               <p>What manner of ſpeaking is this, ſaid <hi>Volumnius?</hi> Is the Soul of a Man of Honor capable to make a Woman of Honor? That which the World entitles a Man of Honor, does glory to be gallant, and favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Ladies; but contrariwiſe, a Woman of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor declines the intrigues of Gallantry, and regards Chaſtity and Modeſty as the two Pillars that ſupport all the other virtues of her Sex. What can <hi>Ovid</hi> mean by the expreſſion then? but that <hi>Sulpicia</hi> am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitioning only the qualities of a Man of Honor, did not pretend to thoſe of a Woman of Honor. What Licentiouſneſs? What Malice is this? I will wager, that <hi>Ovid</hi> would not have ſaid this of the Wife of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſienus,</hi> but in revenge of that ſeverity, which of all virtues in a Woman, he ever expreſt the leaſt eſteem for.</p>
               <p>Whil'ſt <hi>Volumnius</hi> was intent upon his Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Ratiocinations, <hi>Mecoenas</hi> was not leſs on his Poetical diverſions: And after divers Copies of Verſes of the ſame character, he lighted upon a piece of Proſe, the firſt leaf whereof he could not read without ſmiling, and ask'd <hi>Volumnius</hi> whether he had well examin'd the Papers he had brought him. I examine them? My Lord, reply'd the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, the Gods defend me from blaſting my ſoul or my eyes, with reading ſuch no leſs dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, than ſcurrilous vanities; I only lightly perus'd the Verſes which concern'd the Empreſs, and ſeiz'd with the horror of their blaſphemies, came in haſte to deliver the Criminals up into your hands. I have ſupply'd the defect of your curioſity, reply'd <hi>Mece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> ſmiling all the time; and that your zeal may not want its juſt recompence, I will teach you how far it has tranſported you: and in ſaying this, he began to read the Paper out aloud.</p>

               <head>OVID's Apology.</head>
               <p>I here pronounce the Sentence of Condemnation upon all, the Publick lays to my charge. I ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confeſs, that I have alwayes abandon'd my Soul to its own licentious inclinations, dedicated all the faculties thereof to the enjoyment of the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous pleaſures of Love: And as the full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſenſes does ſmother and extinguiſh the light of reaſon, the charms of Love caus'd me to forget and ſlight the due conſideration I ought to have had of the indiſpenſable Laws: but nature and my ſelf are not guilty alone of this crime, Men have contributed more to it than the Stars; and the falſe wiſdom of <hi>Volumnius</hi> did inoculate the firſt grafts of this folly into my Soul.</p>
               <p>How? my Lord, interrupted <hi>Volumnius,</hi> has that ſcandalous Satyriſt aſſign'd me a place too in his Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? What matter is't, anſwer'd <hi>Mecoenas</hi> gravely, a great Philoſopher as you are, ought not to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the liberty of a Poetical extravagance, and continuing his reading,</p>
               <p>All the world, (went he on) knows this <hi>Volum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius:</hi> I entertain'd an eſteem for him upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Fame publiſh'd of his wiſdom; and being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt with his character, I had a ſenſible eſteem likewiſe for all, that he expreſs'd in relation to me. I could not without trouble digeſt his Cenſures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Treatiſe, <hi>de Arte Amandi:</hi> I went to viſit him, with deſign to have ſome conference with him. What would you have with me, ſaid he, as ſoon as he knew my name: I am the ſcourge of the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, the cenſurer of worldlings, and the confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:94435:126"/> of the proud. Have theſe qualities any Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with yours? And can it be poſſible, that one Bond of commerce or friendſhip, can combine <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Volumnius</hi> together? It is ſo poſſible, reply'd I, without ſeeming to be mov'd, that if you were not what you are, and that I were not what I am, I would have nothing to do with you; what need have thoſe, who are in perfect health, of a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian? And who would addreſs himſelf to the wiſe, if he could furniſh himſelf with thoſe Maxims and Inſtructions he comes to demand of them? It is my part, who am wholly deſtitute of thoſe Goods and Riches, to beg a ſupply of them from you. Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe then to impart ſome of them to me, and declare to me, if you pleaſe, by what Arguments you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to extirpate Pride and Voluptuouſneſs out of the World. By reaſon, reply'd <hi>Volumnius</hi> with a ſerious gravity, I ſhall need to borrow none but from her, to convince a reaſonable Creature of their brutality; and that alone I grounded my <hi>Theſis</hi> on, when I demonſtrated, that your Art of Loving, was a contexture of pernicious Maxims, an Academy of all Vice, and a viſible depravation of the Faculties of the Soul.</p>
               <p>I rais'd my voice at this definition, and looking upon <hi>Volumnius</hi> with an eye of admiration, how? ſaid I, Is the Art of reducing into practice the reaſon of a Man, an Art oppoſite to reaſon? And do I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave the Faculties of the Soul, when I teach Men the perfect practice of that, which is the viſible mark of their Being? The viſible mark of their Being, exclaim'd <hi>Volumnius:</hi> Do you call that a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which according to your own Maxims, has no exiſtence but in another? Do not you engage a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to live more in that, which inſpires him with a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94435:126"/> Paſſion, than in that, which inſpires him with a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Do not you make his health, his joy, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and oftentimes his honor, to depend upon the perſon he loves? And has not a Being a more noble dependance than this? And have not I then reaſon to conclude, that your Art of Loving, teaches a Man the Art to return again to his firſt Nothing, from whence the Gods have been pleas'd to draw and extract him?</p>
               <p>This way of reaſoning, as extravagant as it was, ſeem'd to me very pleaſant and ſubtile; and caus'd me to have an eſteem for his wit, though I could not reliſh his Maxims. I pray'd him to infuſe into me as ſenſible a guſt of his Maxims, as they had done already an eſteem of his Learning. But I am afraid you will find it, ſaid I ingenuouſly, a talk of more difficulty than you apprehend; for I never yet found any ſolid pleaſure or ſatisfaction in any thing, but a reciprocal Love, which hitherto I have only regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as a ſubject worthy to captivate all the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Soul the Gods have accompliſht with the greateſt perfections. I beſeech you to manage this paſſion by your prudence for my beſt advantage: And ſince it is not capable to byaſs my Soul, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it from the ſecret inclination it has to Love, let it endeavor to chooſe objects for it moſt worthy its conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Volumnius</hi> was ready to caper for joy, when he heard me make this Propoſition, and promis'd me to ſacrifice all his elucubrations for a happy ſucceſs; and I, for my own part, aſſur'd him of all the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity and diligence he could require of me. In fine, we became inſeparable. And the beginning of this Amity charm'd my Soul with a thouſand pleaſures and delights. He has a ſpirit embelliſh'd with all
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:94435:127"/> curious literature: And does not affect the common method of teaching, practis'd in the Schools, but aſpires to a more noble one. Her reaſons upon the principles of things, has made divers experiments of curioſity, and did diſcover to me a thouſand new ſecrets in Philoſophy, and the Liberal Sciences: But when from theſe artificial qualifications, we deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the reaſon upon thoſe of Nature; Alas! how great Strangers did I find the ſophyſtical Subtilties of this ſage one, to theſe Notions? And how great a grief did I conceive in my mind, that I had ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd ſo much time and ſtudy to ſo empty a vanity? We one day, I know not how, fell into a diſcourſe of the Reign of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and the merit of his Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. Are you one of thoſe Sycophants too, ſaid he, who are accountable to the Gods for the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs of the Age? And encourage it by your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. What do you find ſo diſſolute in the Age, ſaid I, interrupting him, Men labor to live with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and ſatisfaction in it. Will you not allow, that every one ought to render to the Gods an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe Goods he has receiv'd from their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral hands? And if you had given one of your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants a piece of Land to improve, would you be pleaſed if he ſhould leave one half of it cover'd over with buſhes and bryars, and other trumpery? Men are properly the Truſtees of Nature. It is for them, that ſhe daily labors, and is, as I may ſay, brought to Bed of ſuch variety of Productions: And they ought to uſe them with all grateful moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Sea offers us Fiſh, and we muſt employ our induſtry to catch it; the Earth preſents us with Fruits, and we muſt take the pains to gather them. Every Element, every Seaſon furniſhes a Man with varieties, to render his life pleaſant and delicious.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94435:127"/> Behold the Maxims, cry'd out <hi>Volumnius</hi> in a paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon which the vanity and gluttony of the Age are eſtabliſh'd. From the ſource of ſuch <hi>Epicurean</hi> Arguments, ſpring ſo many unbridled deſires, ſo many licentious debaucheries.</p>
               <p>It is by this fanatical pretence of indulging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the uſe of Natures bounty, that Men would oblige the Gods to create every day a new Sea, and a new Earth, if the inſatiability of Worldlings, were as omnipotent, as it is boundleſs.</p>
               <p>Here throwing the looſe reins on the neck of his ſatyrical humor, he committed more unpardonable Errors in one hours diſcourſe, than one of <hi>Venus</hi>'s profeſt Idolaters would have done in a ten years Love-intrigue. No ſtate, no condition of life eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the laſh of his rage. He tax'd the Senate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsneſs, the People of blindneſs, the Court of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, and the Soldiers of effeminacy. There was nothing ſo ſacred, which his tongue did not profane; Ladies of the ſevereſt virtue were accus'd by him of diſſimulation, the Prieſts of hypocriſie, and even the purity it ſelf of Veſtals, blemiſh'd by the imparity of his Cenſures.</p>
               <p>What, ſaid I to him, Are theſe the fruits of that wiſdom you make ſo glorious a profeſſion of? Are detraction, diſreſpect and contempt of your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, the <hi>Baſis,</hi> on which you have rais'd to your ſelf that ſplendid Title of a Reverend Sage? And to demonſtrate your ſelf to be a reaſonable Animal, do you accuſe all the reſt of the World of brutality and folly? Ho! What is the World, reply'd he, but a confus'd Maſs, and contexture of brain-ſick follies? Does the Lawyer, who conſumes his litigious dayes in deciding Controverſies, wherein he is ſeldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, merit the Title of a wiſe Man? Does not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:94435:128"/> the Courtier, who makes himſelf the Ape of all new faſhions, and ſacrifices his repoſe, his health, and his eſtate, to the <hi>capricio</hi> of every new Mode, deſerve to be enroll'd in the Catalogue of Fools? Does not the Madam, who by a thouſand affected vanities ſpins her ſelf the web, wherein the painted Butterflie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnares her own liberty and honor, deſerve to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Mad-ame, or Mad Soul indeed? And is not the Lover, who lies whining at the feet of this Lady Fooliſh, as great a Fool himſelf? Who is then, ſaid I, interrupting him, a wiſe Man in your opinion? My ſelf, reply'd <hi>Volumnius,</hi> with a ſtarch'd gravity of countenance; who free from the engagements and tumults of the world, center in my ſelf my own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and my own felicity: Alas, ſaid I, do you call that chagrin and thoſe virulent dregs of a flegmatick Soul, which you ſo peeviſhly vent againſt all other Men, a true repoſe? Does that ſatyrical humor, which has even devour'd up in you all ſenſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; which will not ſuffer my Muſe quietly to addict herſelf to the Noble Art of Loving, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attacking her with loud reproaches, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the Univerſe to you, in the ſhape of a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, compos'd of nothing but honor and deformity; and which under the pretence of a petulant cenſure, does, without intermiſſion, hound you on upon all Mankind, does all this, I ſay, deſerve the name of a calm tranquility of ſpirit? No, no, <hi>Volumnius,</hi> you do not carry a calm, but a tempeſt in your breaſt; and the frothy effects of it flie up into your brain, and intoxicate your reaſon. The opinion, you che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, of your own wiſdom, is an Arrogance, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable than that, of which you impeach the proudeſt Worldlings; and they need not ſo ſtrong an Antidote to preſerve themſelves from the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94435:128"/> contagion of thoſe ſoft pleaſures, to which you declare your ſelf a mortal enemy, as they do from the venom of your injurious Cenſures. A Lover concerns himſelf with nothing but what concerns his Love. All the Evils, which his Paſſion is the Author of, flow both to and from himſelf; And he eſteems himſelf ſo much oblig'd to thoſe, who give no diſturbance to his innocent Amours, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the obligation, he gives a free pardon to all the miſcarriages of the Age; you on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, being partial to your ſelf, and obnoxious to all others, think to avoid the imputation of a private ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy and weakneſs, by a licentious inveighing againſt the glory and authority of other Men. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, <hi>Volumnius,</hi> you were never wiſe. Wiſdom is more modeſt, and more prudent. You are more a ſlave to your paſſion, than the voluptuous Man, whoſe ſcourge you glory to call your ſelf, is to his: And to obey their peeviſh inſtigations, you brand the Actions of Virtue and Innocence it ſelf; and repoſe that pleaſure and ſatisfaction in this, which another finds in the regaling of his ſenſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Volumnius</hi> confirm'd all by his ungovern'd paſſion, that I had alledg'd againſt him: and ſcorning to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himſelf convinc'd, he broke out of the liſts of the diſpute, and launching himſelf forth into a wild Ocean of bitter invectives, he poſſeſs'd me with a greater contempt of his vanity, than report had done before, with an eſteem for his virtue. We parted ill ſatisfied with one another. And ever ſince that day, he has us'd ſo zealous a diligence in ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all opportunities of doing me an injury, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the effecting it, Inſtruments ſo baſe and unworthy, and I have found his Soul ſo ſuſceptible of all ſordid and mechanical impreſſions, that he has
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94435:129"/> convinc'd me, that a truly wiſe Man, is one diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite to <hi>Voluminus.</hi> I have alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt as great a reſpect and eſteem for the counſels of my Friends, as he has obſtinacy to have fix'd me to his blind Errors: He has endeavor'd to make me feel the malicious effects of his revenge, and I have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly pardon'd all his miſchievous intentions: He thinks himſelf the only perſon in the world, worthy of its admiration and praiſe, and I receive thoſe, as a favor, it flatters me with; and ſo by a conſequent <hi>ſeries</hi> of the like oppoſitions, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated all the Faculties of my Soul, to the charms of that divine paſſion, againſt which <hi>Volumnius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes ſo inhumane an antipathy and horror.</p>
               <p>It was to have been wiſh'd for the diverſion of <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> that this Comick Scene had preceded the Tragical Relation of <hi>Craſſus;</hi> it would have afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very pleaſant one to any perſon whoſe thoughts had not been embaras't with other cares and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions. The miſtaken Saga ſwelling with inward rage and deſpight, and not daring to give them vent, chang'd his colour as often, as the Apology did its ſtile. He gave himſelf ſome ſecret Applauſes, for having forc'd <hi>Ovid</hi> to attribute a few to him in his diſcourſe, and dy'd his flaming cheeks in their own bluſhes, when he conſider'd in others, how ſeverely he was handled by him: And conjecturing by the frequent ſmiles of <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> which he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that his ſhame was his diverſion, he would ſuddenly grow as pale, as Envy could paint him, with grief and confuſion. But the illuſtrious wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe reciprocal Agitations, was ſcarce in a capacity to remark them. His Soul, which like a Shipwrackt Veſſel, was ſinking in the turbulent bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of its own cares, had no leiſure to intereſt it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94435:129"/> ſelf in the concerns of another. He took his leave of <hi>Volumnius,</hi> and telling him, in an ironical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, that he would acquaint the Emperor with the promptitude and parity of his zeal to ſerve him, he went haſtily to the Chamber of <hi>Phedra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He found her in a condition capable to diſarm his choler: ſhe had been inform'd of <hi>Craſſus</hi>'s diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; ſhe accus'd her ſelf of being the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of it: And this grief being join'd to that of ſeeing her Love diſdain'd, involv'd her in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of mortal reſentments. Her eyes, whoſe lively ſparkling is generally one of the moſt powerful charms of beauty, were ſeiz'd with a languiſhing dulneſs, and ſeem'd to implore the compaſſion of all they were fix'd upon. Her body, whoſe elegant proportion might challenge the title of one of the moſt beautiful Structures in the world, was negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently extended upon a Couch; which by her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and dejectedneſs, ſhe ſeem'd to have choſen for her tomb. <hi>Mecoenas</hi> regarded her awhile, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being diſcover'd; and his heart, which Nature had made the ſeat of compaſſion, not able long to harbor ſo unnatural a Gueſt, as his new-conceiv'd indignation, he began inſenſibly to yield to the ſoft impreſſions of the firſt: But then again in the ſame inſtant recollecting his thoughts, and reflecting, that it was a conſideration for his Rival, and not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that had reduc'd her to that condition, unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful one, cry'd he out aloud, how dareſt thou teſtifie ſo many viſible marks of an affection, which both a juſt gratitude, and the ſolemn engagement of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perjur'd vows, ought to have ſurmounted, or at leaſt conceal'd from the ſurmiſes of the whole world. <hi>Phedra</hi> turning her languiſhing eyes to that ſide, from whence the voice came, and conſidering
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94435:130"/> 
                  <hi>Mecoenas</hi> leſs, as an exaſperated Lover, then a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Favourite of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Ha! my Lord, ſaid ſhe to him, What will you do with <hi>Craſſus?</hi> Shall he be baniſhed, impriſoned, or treated with more rigor? He ſhall not want puniſhment, ſince thou haſt ſo much ingratitude, reply'd <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> Thy love has pronounc'd his condemnation; and thou would'ſt doubt whither ever I lov'd thee, or no, if after what I know, and what I am able to do, the Crime of <hi>Craſſus</hi> ſhould ſcape unpuniſh'd. He has receiv'd the puniſhment, he merits, in me already, reply'd the weeping <hi>Phedra,</hi> and the Gods could not make me more unhappy, then in having made me the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy inſtrument of your revenge.</p>
               <p>Conſider me, my Lord, both as what I am, and what I ought to be; you love me, you are one of the moſt charming, and moſt eminent perſons of the Empire: To you I owe my liberty, and to you I might have ow'd all, that your high credit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all within the extent of its Dominions: I do not love you; and I love an Ingrate, who draws up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me as many maligne effects of your favor, as I might have hop'd for benigne ones from it. What can your revenge ambition more? Am I not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enough in my own perſon, but I muſt ſuffer too in that of <hi>Craſſus?</hi> But unjuſt and treacherous <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi> interrupted <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> What ſervices, what obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations have ingrafted <hi>Craſſus</hi> ſo deeply in your Soul? How has he merited, to ſee himſelf the object of all your love, whil'ſt I am the ſubject of all you ingratitude? How, has <hi>Terentia,</hi> merited my Lord, anſwered <hi>Phedra,</hi> to be only the ſubject of your cold Careſſes, whilſt a poor Bond-ſlave is the object of all your real Flames? You have not always had theſe conſiderations, ingrateful one, reply'd <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coenas:</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:94435:130"/> I have not always lov'd <hi>Craſſus,</hi> my Lord, ſaid <hi>Phedra,</hi> and as long as this Paſſion did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat that, I nouriſht for you, my devoir oblig'd me to obſerve all your deſires, as a moſt inviolable Law; but ſince I have chang'd the proſpect, and with other eyes regard them, I find them not more legal and juſt than my own. What reproach can you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to me for loving <hi>Craſſus?</hi> You that impute none to your ſelf, for preferring me before the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent Beauty of the Empire? Oh! ingrateful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſaid <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> interrupting her, you turn thoſe weapons upon me, which you ought to convert upon your ſelf: for ſince I have preferr'd you before <hi>Terentia,</hi> you ought to have preferr'd me before all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the World. And calling to mind the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I have formerly offer'd to all your deſires, they ought to convince you of the injuſtice of theſe, you now cheriſh in oppoſition to me. Alas! my Lord, reply'd the amorous <hi>Phedra,</hi> as they were too pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to be convinc'd by me, ſo the power they acted by they did not derive from me. And do you think, that I expected a detachement from your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, before I ſummoned all the forces of my Devoir into the Field? No, my Lord, if the ſtrongeſt oppoſition could have conquered this Paſſion, it ſhould not have led the unfortunate Slave <hi>Phedra</hi> through <hi>Rome</hi> in triumph after it. I have repreſented all the engagements, I have to you, with all their height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning circumſtances, to the conſideration of my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; and ſcorning to entertain ſuch mean thoughts of your love, as to believe that that forced you to do for me, what you did, I ſtampt the character of an obligation upon the leaſt of your favors. But, my Lord, the moſt endearing obligations cannot alter Decrees of the Stars; and though I muſt always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94435:131"/> you for a moſt illuſtrious Benefactor, yet cannot cheriſh the ſame tender eſteem for you, as I do for the the too ingrateful and too charming <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>

               <p>This diſcourſe forced ſo many mournful complaints from the amorous <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> that he had not ended them before he was inform'd of the Emperors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: and being unwilling to be ſurpriz'd in <hi>Phedra's</hi> Chamber, he retired out of it in as much confuſion as he had firſt entred into it: he could not reſolve to digeſt the bitter Pill, he had been forced to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; nor ſo far renounce all his hopes of reducing the ingrateful falſe One back to her devoir, as to alarm the Court with the ſo exotick a Novelty. He calmed, as well as he could, his thoughts, and his countenance: gave ſome minutes attendance upon <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in his Chamber; and not judging it ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to publiſh yet the ſecret of this Intrigue, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to his own Apartment; where leaving him and the reſt of the Court to their repoſe, we will return again to <hi>Tuſculum,</hi> to examine what paſſes there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the diſgraced <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his noble friend <hi>Virgil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were no ſooner in a capacity to unboſome with freedom their thoughts to each other, when <hi>Cornelius</hi> calling the beautiful <hi>Phila</hi> to his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, conjur'd <hi>Virgil</hi> to relate to him the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the Intrigue, which had been betwixt them.

               <head>THE HISTORY OF Virgil.</head>
               <p>AN illuſtrious deſcent, ſaid he, is a gift of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which entails no hereditary glory upon the receivers; it coſts them neither ſtudy, nor labor, and it is ſo far from deſerving the title of Merit, that it is oftentimes an obſtacle to the acquiring it: But yet, my Lord, it ought to be confeſt, that though it be not the reward, it is the luſtre of Virtue, and that illuſtrious qualities ſhine not in their native ſplendor and orb, but in a Subject of an illuſtrious Title.</p>
               <p>I labor'd a long time under this injuſtice of Fate, and it was that which caus'd me to take my leave of my Countrey, more than the flaming ruines of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful <hi>Mantua.</hi> Its deſtruction deſtroy'd none of my riches, nor my dignities: My loſſes by the Fire were not ſo great, but that a ſmall Cott was able to repair them: But the obſcurity of my birth, eclips d all the luſtre of my Talents; and as I valu'd my ſelf more upon the nobleneſs of my deſerts, than of my
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:94435:132"/> deſcent, I was very willing to exchange my native Air for any other, where my perſon might be better known, than my extraction.</p>
               <p>You know, my Lord, how this deſign ſucceeded; I was favor'd by <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> and preſented by him to the Emperor; and within a ſhort time, obtain'd the place of Superviſor, for the tranſportation of wheat, and all other grain, wherewith the Iſle of <hi>Sicily</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies <hi>Rome.</hi> I was ambitious to ſhew my ſelf wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Employ I was honor'd with; and I not only dedicated all my cares and diligence to advance the fruitful harveſts of every ſeaſon, but likewiſe to improve them to an advantage, that Iſland had never before been ſenſible of. I taught the Inhabitants a new, and more beneficial way of tillage; I gave them many wholeſom Precepts for the increaſe of the health and fecundity of their Cattle: This method, which no man had taught, or practis'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me in that place, render'd me familiar and in high eſteem with perſons of that calling. They would come and conſult me upon all their affairs, and I have a thouſand times admir'd, to ſee what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Nature takes to repair in them by ingenuity and induſtry, the injuſtice Fortune has done them by a blind partiality. My Lord, ſayes an old Man, in whoſe innocent converſe I took great delight, one day to me, What is this Fortune, of which I have heard you diſcourſe ſo often; you call Her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times unjuſt and capricious, and at other times you reverence Her, as a Goddeſs; and, in effect, you have inroll'd her in the Catalogue of your Deities, and dedicated Temples to Her in <hi>Rome?</hi> Tell me, I pray you what Authority has She over Mortals? Does She ſend them into the world? Can She take them out of it? Or maintain them in health in it?
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:94435:132"/> She does not do any of all this, ſaid I, ſhe cann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> deſtroy the World; but ſhe furniſhes it with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, without which, it would be leſs to be deſired, than death it ſelf. But, reply'd the old man, ſhe has furniſh'd me with none of the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, you ſpeak of; my labour, is the only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, I ſubſiſt by; which is ſcarce able to feed and cloath me, and yet I live contented. If you live contented, ſaid I, you are one of fortunes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, and ſhe has given you all that ſhe can give you. But, reply'd he, all that ſhe has given me, would not render another perhaps, ſo contented, as I am. Young <hi>Coridon,</hi> who is ſo handſom, and who has ſo many Commodities, is always mumuring againſt <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</hi> His rich Unkle <hi>Melibeus,</hi> dotes on him, and maintains him like a Lord; and yet how comes it to paſs, that he, who has every thing that I have, ſhould continually be making complaints; and that I, who have not half of what he has, ſhould live contented with my condition? How? ſaid I, From hence that he to the abundance, he has, covets more; and that the little you have does fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your deſires. It is not fortune then, reply'd the old man, which is able to create either out diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, or our joys; we need not court her either in Heaven, or upon Earth; we need not raiſe Altars, or Temples to her; ſince all our felicity conſiſts in being contented, with what the Gods have beſtow'd upon us. I am glad I have learnt ſo excellent a Leſſon to day: I ſhall remember it, when I hear <hi>Coridon</hi> make his complaints, and I ſhall not fail to tell him, that he ought to attribute to himſelf, not to fortune, the diſſatisfaction he finds in his condition.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Coridon</hi> had addicted himſelf to a very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:94435:133"/> courſe of life; and though he liv'd in a near neighbouring Village to my houſe, I had never ſeen him. I had a curioſity to underſtand, what it was, that oblig'd him, to frame thoſe continual complaints. He came one evening with ſome of his Companions into a Meadow, where I was wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: and as ſoon as I ſaw him, I was convinc'd, that it was not without reaſon, that they call'd him, <hi>Coridon the Fair;</hi> for I had never beheld a more charming Beauty. I askt him, that ſince he was only born a Peaſant, and yet commanded all conveniences ſuch a life could furniſh him with, Why he was always railing againſt Fortune? You ask me a great Secret, my Lord, ſaid he, fetching a deep ſigh, and if I could impart it to you, it would much lighten the burden of theſe afflictions, I groan under.</p>
               <p>His Unkle came to us, as he had finiſht thoſe laſt words; and deſiring me not to give ear to his idle diſcourſe, made a ſign to him, to retire: Why do you chaſe him away? ſaid I to <hi>Melibeus;</hi> you ſhould have ſuffer'd him to tell me, what it is that troubles him. Perhaps I could adminiſter him ſome wholeſom Phyſick for his diſtemper: Alas! my Lord, reply'd his Unkle, What can he tell you? He is a Lunatick, who is neither capable of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to you the cauſe of his complaint, nor of any advice that can be given to moderate them. He ſpent his firſt years at <hi>Athens,</hi> where he apply'd himſelf to nothing but the reading of Fables and Romances, which have deprav'd his judgment. He hatches ſtrange Chimera's in his fancy, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes them up in his folly; and ſeeing me refuſe to flatter his brain-ſick humors, he will oftentimes go and addreſs his complaints to Rocks and Trees,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:94435:133"/> as if they were capable to underſtand and relieve him.</p>
               <p>This frenſie of this beautiful Youth, mov'd me to compaſſionate him. I ſent to a famous <hi>Grecian,</hi> who profeſt Phyſick in <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> for his advice, and deſir'd him to employ the beſt of his skill, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his diſtemper'd Brain to its native ſtrength and vivacity. The <hi>Grecian</hi> return'd me a learn'd and ſatisfactory anſwer; preſcrib'd the uſe of certain Simples, and aſſur'd me of a favourable ſucceſs. I went to find <hi>Melibeus,</hi> to communicate his advice to him; and as I was in the midſt of a little Wood, which I was to paſs thorough to go to the houſe of that good man; I thought I heard my ſelf nam'd; I lent a diligent attention, and heard one ſay;</p>
               <p>Conſider into what a gulf of dangers you would have precipitated your ſelf, had not I, by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn'd diſguiſe of an imaginary folly, found a means to preſerve you from it. <hi>Virgil</hi> has a curious and piercing judgment; he would have ſoon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the ſecret, you are ſo much oblig'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal: And that perhaps may be the misfortune, which they have poſſeſt your Father with ſo ſtrong an apprehenſion of: And if Heaven had not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely ſent me to your relief, one moment of indiſcretion might have render'd the precautions and care of eight entire years, wholly ineffectual, Oh! cruel precautions, anſwered the perſon, to whom the other ſpoke; I am able no longer to enſlave my ſelf to them. This baſe diſguiſe, the prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of my baniſhment, the ruſtick employment to which I am forc'd to apply my ſelf, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret repugnance and antipathy I have againſt them, accompliſh the the Propheſie, which they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:94435:134"/> to avert from me; they advanc'd it, in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus to preſerve me from the menaces of it; and the diſaſters, which the Stars threaten me, are not ſo much to be apprehended by me, as thoſe, wherein the provident care, as you term it, of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi> does daily involve me.</p>
               <p>It is ſtrange, reply'd he, who had begun the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that the prudence and affection of a tender Father, ſuch as <hi>Antiochus</hi> is, ſhould be ſuſpected by you, of cruelty, and indiſcretion. Do you think, that he has not maturely weighed the reaſons and conſequences of his proceedings? Your reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has hitherto been his joy and his glory; And I wonder, that having not above five or ſix months to ſuffer, thoſe ſhould become more inſupportable to you, than all the former years of your confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>My tender age, reply'd this perſon, and the hopes I had to enjoy in a ſhort time my enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did, as it were, skreen its horror from my eyes; but ſince <hi>Antiochus</hi> declar'd to me in his laſt Voyage, that it was to be continued to the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of my age, I was ſeiz'd with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tranſports of grief and impatience, as my firmeſt conſtancy, was not able to triumph over. The liberty which the young Shepherds, with whom I am forc'd to conſort, licentiouſly indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the amorous perſecutions of old <hi>Neryſa,</hi> and the tender complaints of young <hi>Daphne,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it every moment to the extreameſt Teſt. I am not able <hi>Melibeus,</hi> any longer to keep my tongue priſoner, as you keep my perſon; and it is time now that the World ſhould hear me ſpeak that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of <hi>Phila,</hi> which you force me often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:94435:134"/> to utter amongſt our Shepherds under the name of <hi>Corydon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was ſo attentive to this diſcourſe, that the ſame <hi>Neryſa,</hi> which <hi>Corydon</hi> had juſt then ſpoken of, came to the place where I ſtood, and was within two or three paces of me, before I diſcover'd her. I laugh oftentimes, when I think of this Creature. She was the Widow of <hi>Pollio,</hi> whom you knew, at your firſt coming into the World; and having retir'd her ſelf into <hi>Sicily,</hi> where ſhe had a fair Dowry, ſhe became ſo beſotted with the Charms of <hi>Corydon,</hi> that ſhe both forgot her age and her honor, to become a young Votary of <hi>Cupid.</hi> She went dreſt like a young Country Girl. She made one at all youthful Sports and Paſtimes of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds and Shepherdeſſes: and crowning with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of Flowers that head, which ſhe had thatcht for many years with purchaſt Hair: She would play as wantonly with little Dogs and Monkies, as if ſhe were juſt then ſtept into that age, wherein ſuch childiſh gallantries may paſs for an ornament. She askt me what curioſity had invited me thither, and what it was that I leant ſo diligent an ear to? To your praiſes, Madam, ſaid I, which declare, that in this Habit, you would force the youthful <hi>Paris</hi> to pay a homage to your Charms; and ſerve for an original to copy forth the beautiful Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs <hi>Enona</hi> by. You are a Flatterer, ſaid ſhe, with a ſmile (which envy would have been apt to call a grin) I do not aim by this dreſs, to attract the admiration, or envy of my neighbors; but one knows not otherways, how to divert themſelves in the Country; and beſides, I owe this ſlight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, to the kindneſs of the Shepherds, I live amongſt, who with ſo much care and reſpect,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:94435:135"/> ſolemnize yearly the day of my birth. So gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me her hand, and leading me to a Caſtle, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which the Wood, we were then in, by a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Walk conducted us, ſhe entreated me to ſtay, and be a witneſs of the innocent diverſions, which her neighbors were preparing for her. We en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into a Hall, which was ſuddenly fill'd with young Fellows, and Country-wenches, who brought every one a ſmall Preſent, ſuitable to his ability; and attended with divers ruſtical inſtruments, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented us with a very pleaſant Ball after their Country faſhion. The young <hi>Daphne,</hi> Niece to <hi>Neryſa,</hi> (whom <hi>Corydon</hi> had mention'd before in the diſcourſe, I had over-heard) had by the command of her Aunt, rankt her ſelf amongſt them, and choſen two or three young Girles for her Companions, whoſe pretty ſimplicity and innocence, might have rais'd emulation even in the moſt admired Beauties of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Court; but both my eyes and my attention were ſo eager'y fixt upon the counterfeit <hi>Corydon,</hi> that I had no more left me, to beſtow upon any other Object.</p>
               <p>Never did Beauty receive leſs advantage by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, nor addreſs more glory from Beauty, than in this incomparable perſon. I admir'd, how that being a Girl, ſhe was able with ſuch dexterity to perform the exerciſes of the contrary Sex: and in a moment after, I wonder'd as much, how in the diſguiſe of a Boy, ſhe could preſerve the glory of her own, with ſo much ſweetneſs and modeſty. The old <hi>Neryſa</hi> devour'd her with her eyes; and pregnant with a Paſſion, that every action ſeem'd to labor to be deliver'd of; ſhe askt me with a tranſported countenance, if that Youth did not merit a Fortune more noble, than his birth; and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:94435:135"/> what I would ſay of that perſon, who to repair the injuſtice, fate had done him, ſhould raiſe him to one worthy of himſelf? I would ſay, ſaid I, that that perſon would give a moſt excellent teſtimony of his judgment; and that if I were born a Prince, and could find a ſimple Shepherdeſs, accompliſh'd with ſo many Charms and Perfections in her Sex, as <hi>Corydon</hi> is in his, I ſhould make no ſcruple, to make her a Princeſs. <hi>Neryſa</hi> hugg'd me in her Arms for this anſwer, and highly extolling it, for a rare principle of equity in me; I have the ſame ſentiments, ſaid ſhe, as you have; and were it not out of a chimerical apprehenſion, that I ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the cenſure of the ſcandalous World, I ſwear, I had long ſince inveſted him with all my poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. It ſhall be ſo yet, went ſhe on; as if ſhe had finally determin'd it: your learned diſcourſes have quite non plus't all my ſcruples; and you ſhall ſee in a ſhort time what a veneration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, I have for them: Not that I was ever fond of Marriage from a Girl; nor had I ever enter'd into it, but by the expreſs command of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and I had a natural averſion to co-habit with <hi>Pollio</hi> in any other way than as a Siſter with a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; But I make a conſcience of ſuffering <hi>Cory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to be bury'd in the obſcurity, wherein he was born; and I ſhall hereby demonſtrate to the World, that it is oblige men to the practiſe of ſuch acts of juſtice, that the Gods have created ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in their fortunes.</p>
               <p>I could have deriv'd a pleaſant diverſion from her extravagant follies, had not I began to feel in my ſelf an incroaching Paſſion, which fill'd my Breaſt with chagrin and diſquiet. I attempted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, dancing the Dance, to draw the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:94435:136"/> 
                  <hi>Corydon</hi> aſide, and diſcover ſome of my thoughts to her; but old <hi>Melibeus,</hi> did watch her ſo narrowly, that I could gain no opportunity of ſpeaking to her, but in his preſence. I fetcht ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a deep ſigh for grief; and ſeeing all the rural Squadron retire, and I not able to effect my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, I return'd in a melancholly humor towards my own Houſe, thorough the ſame Wood, by which I had come before; when I could hear old <hi>Neryſa</hi> in a furious tone, thundring out terrible menaces againſt her young Niece <hi>Daphne.</hi> I deſir'd her to tell me what it was, that had provok'd her to ſo much indignation. What is it? ſaid ſhe, ſtaring upon me, like a Woman half diſtracted, this young Slut, which I have bred up from the Cradle, as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly as if ſhe had been a Daughter of my own, and to whom, thanks to the Gods, I have ever given nothing, but examples of virtue, prefers her own giddy-brain'd inclinations, before my virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Precepts. I found her juſt now making a thouſand Careſſes to <hi>Melibeus</hi> his young Nephew. For Heavens ſake tell me my Joy, went ſhe on, giving the Girl no time to make her an anſwer, which of my actions does authorize you to live with me in this debauchery? I do not diſallow of innocent Recreations; and being not yet arriv'd to thoſe years of gravity, as to renounce the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Society, I profeſs, I cannot reconcile the gaity of my humor to that air of ſeverity, which entombs many women alive at the age of four times ten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their own houſes, as in a Veſtal Cloyſter; but Virtue, you know, my Lord, will ſhine in what Orb ſoever you fix it. I conſecrate my ſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſolid and eſſential diverſions: Take example by me, fooliſh Girl, to comport your ſelf, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:94435:136"/> force me not by your impudence to ſend you back again to the Wilderneſs, from whence I took you. I endeavour'd the beſt I could to appeaſe the fury of this old Tygreſs, and being conſcious to my ſelf that <hi>Daphne</hi> could not be guilty, but in intention only; I deſir'd, <hi>Neryſa</hi> not to ſuffer her affection to her Neece to be ſeduc'd by vain ſurmiſes. Vain ſurmiſes! cry'd ſhe out; I am neither diſtracted, nor blind. I ſaw with theſe eyes this young Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion follow <hi>Corydon,</hi> as he went out of my houſe; I had a curioſity to ſee what they intended; I ſtole ſoftly after them; and I heard <hi>Daphne</hi> reproach him, becauſe in the Dance he had not vouchſaf'd to caſt one look upon her; call him ingrateful, and beg his Heart of him, with expreſſions, that cauſe me to bluſh at the very thoughts of them. That famous Fabler, had a great deal of reaſon on his ſide, when by his tale of the Cat transformed into a Woman, he demonſtrated to us, that Nature will be always Miſtreſs. <hi>Corydon</hi> was born upon the Dunghil of a Country Village, and will ſmell of it as long as he lives: He has no ſence of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ambition, and inſtead of endeavouring to pleaſe me, or reach at Riches, Glory, or Dignities, he runs creeping after this young Slattertaile, which has not a penny, but what my charity will beſtow upon her. It is not for her Beauty, (run ſhe on, giving a freſh looſe in the fury of her Carreer) ſet aſide a little ſnout-fair Paint of youth, which will ſooner or later decay, and a little breeding and bonne grace, which my care and charges have purchaſt her, I have without vanity a more mature judgment, and am more deſirable than ſhe.</p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:94435:137"/>
               <p>I applauded all ſhe ſaid, and being touch'd with compaſſion for poor <hi>Daphne,</hi> who was with ſo much injuſtice ſuſpected of a crime, ſhe was not capable of committing, I offer'd all the reaſons to the rage of the old Vixon, which I thought might appeaſe it. <hi>Corydon</hi> came to underſtand what I had done, and acknowledging my generoſity, came to give me thanks for the good office.</p>
               <p>It was not a bare point of generoſity, lovely Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, ſaid I to her, but a Motive more powerful, that commanded thoſe ſmall ſervices, you ſet ſo high a value on; and I ſhall expect for all others, I ſhall conſecrate to you hereafter, a recompence worthy of their Merit. Alas! My Lord, reply'd the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Corydon,</hi> with a ſigh, what recompence can you expect from a poor Shepherd, which Fortune has choſen to be the object of her ſcorn, and who being as deſtitute of wealth, as of credit, is capable to pay no other recompence for a favor receiv'd, than that of impotent vows and acknowledgments? The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment you offer, fair <hi>Corydon,</hi> ſaid I, is not ſo inconſiderable, as you imagine it; you have a heart in your power to diſpoſe of, and I would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it at the whole price of my Soul, if you would impoſe no higher upon it.</p>
               <p>The fair diſguiz'd, dy'd her cheeks in ſcarlet, and ſtepping back two or three paces, ſeem'd by that eloquent motion to tell me I had forgot, to whom I addreſs'd my diſcourſe. Moderate your aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaid I, Beauty can challenge no particular Sex for its object; and though you really were, what you ſeem to be, I might uſurp the priviledge without exception, to admire that, which Nature has fram'd ſo admirable. But, charming <hi>Corydon,</hi> you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to your ſelf, that I have a more ſolid founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:94435:137"/> to raiſe a Temple on to the Divinity of Love: and without giving a clearer explanation to my thoughts, I conſtitute your ſelf the Judge to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, whether the Divinity, I mention'd, may not claim the ſacrifice of my heart, with as much juſtice, as if he were the moſt reſplendent Beauty of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p>A Courier arriving from <hi>Mecoenas</hi> with private Orders, whom I was oblig'd to diſpatch in haſte, interrupted our longer converſe; but I omitted no ſtratagem, nor aſſiduity, for the renewing it again with the firſt opportunity. Love is a ſubtile poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which in a moment paſſes through our ſenſes to our heart. I ſpoke, I urg'd, I diſcover'd to her what I knew of her condition, and how miraculouſly I came to the knowledge of it. In fine <hi>Corydon,</hi> or I ſhould rather now ſay, <hi>Phila,</hi> told me, that a learned Aſtrologer came to <hi>Athens,</hi> when ſhe was not above ſeven years old, had gain'd the acquaintance of her father, and aſſur'd him, that if he did not conceal her from the eyes of the whole world, till ſhe had attain'd to the 17th year of her age, her life ſhould be unfortunate, and inviron'd with innumerous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters; and on the contrary, if he obſerv'd the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution he gave him, he ſhould ſee his daughter one of the moſt fortunate perſons that ever came into the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> perſuading himſelf that theſe Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were infallible, (added the fair <hi>Phila</hi>) caus'd a rumor to be ſpread abroad of my death; and having committed me to the charge of old <hi>Melibeus,</hi> who had formerly been one of his Servants, he has conceal'd me for theſe nine years in this Iſland, in the diſguiſe you now ſee me: And I, perhaps, ſhould have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it with more conſtancy, if the loath'd careſſes
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:94435:138"/> of old <hi>Neriſa,</hi> and the continual expoſtulations of young <hi>Daphne,</hi> had not quite exhauſted my pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I abhor that old amorous piece of decrepid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and I tenderly affect her deluded Niece. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and diſdain ſollicite me to expoſe one to open confuſion, and love and friendſhip privately to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive the other: But I dare not obey either of theſe temptations. <hi>Melibeus</hi> is continually ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, that the felicity, or infelicity of my life, depends upon my ſecrecy: he has ſo often inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this to me, that I have now no power to doubt it; and I give as ſacred a belief to the predictions of that Aſtrologer, as I ſhould do to the voice of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> himſelf: And I tremble with ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>or, to think, that as I am now ſpeaking to you with ſo much frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I perhaps advance that cruel deſtiny, which they ſo carefully ſtudy to avert from me.</p>
               <p>I encourag'd <hi>Phila</hi> againſt the vanity of her appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, and finding a heart in her, which as unpra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd and as young as it was, might eaſily be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to receive the impreſſions of a paſſion, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor'd to manage this favorable conjuncture of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and innocence to the beſt advantage. I inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelf into the good opinion of <hi>Melibeus.</hi> I never ſpoke to his Nephew in his preſence, but my diſcourſe was an abſolute harangue of virtue, and obedience to Parents; And though I oftentimes took up this theam as much by accident, as deſign, it ſo ſtrongly enchanted the fancy of the old Man, that he would ſend <hi>Phila</hi> purpoſely to me for my inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and aſſur'd himſelf that ſhe was in as great ſecurity under my conduct and charge, as in his own.</p>
               <p>Oh! ye Gods! what an age of felicity did every moment then of my life include! It was in thoſe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:94435:138"/> auſpicious dayes, that I compos'd thoſe paſſionate Eglogues, which you took ſo much delight to read; the laws of my duty comply'd then with the deſires of my heart; and I receiv'd as much applauſe from <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> for my Government in <hi>Sicily,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> did ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the actions by which <hi>I</hi> purchas'd it. The day approach'd, when the diſguiſed <hi>Phila</hi> was to pull off that Vizard-Mask, which had ſo long clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the eyes of the world her native ſplendor; and my eſtate, <hi>I</hi> now thought, was grown conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable enough, to challenge the aſſent of <hi>Antiochus.</hi> But blind Love does oftentimes want the foreſeeing eyes of prudence; and we did not weigh in her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial ſcales, the dangers to which the vigilance of our watchful Spies might expoſe us.</p>
               <p>The flames of <hi>Neriſa</hi> ſeem'd to borrow new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies daily from the coldneſs of <hi>Corydon:</hi> ſhe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted him with a Love, that at length degenerated into an open fury; and finding that he grew every day more and more rebellious to her raging deſires, ſhe imagin'd that my counſels blew the coals both of his diſdain, and her own ſhame. <hi>I</hi> carried my ſelf, as a perſon indifferent, towards the rural Beauties of our Neighborhood: And as none could divine, that the counterfeit <hi>Corydon</hi> had caus'd in me this indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, all interpreted that a default of Love in me, which was properly the exceſs of it. <hi>Neriſa</hi> believ'd that I inſtill'd pernicious Maxims into the Soul of <hi>Corydon;</hi> and acting the old Dragon, who was the Keeper of the <hi>Heſperian</hi> Garden, ſhe with never-ſleeping eyes watch'd this golden fruit of her heart; and one evening ſurpriz'd us at a private Cabal, which we held under the overſpreading Canopy of a thick quickſet Hedge, that prov'd a treacherous Skreen, to intercept from us the ſight of that old</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:94435:139"/>
               <p>Dragoneſs: Ha! my Lord, What think you, was the diſcourſe, we entertained thoſe few bleſſed minutes with, of ſuch importance, that <hi>Neryſa</hi> could not have expected any of ſo great? I was blaming <hi>Phila,</hi> for not forcing her inclination to expreſs a little more complaiſance for the error, ſhe ſaw her involv'd in.</p>
               <p>She may do us a diſpleaſure, ſaid I to her; ſhe has a great intereſt in this place; and <hi>Melibeus</hi> Rents the Eſtate of her, he lives in; for which you ought to pay her the ſmall acknowledgement of a little fein'd complaiſance. Make all her fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick diſcourſes and addreſſes, your ſport and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. Ha! <hi>Virgil,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I ſhall never be able to extort from my ſelf that complaiſance, you plead for. I could heretofore with more equity, and leſs trouble, digeſt the follies of <hi>Neriſa;</hi> and as long as her diſcourſes, only invaded my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and reaſon, I ſuffer'd them with patience enough: But ſince now they begin to invade the confines too of my fidelity, they are become whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſupportable to me. I know, that my heart is not ſuſpected to be what it is; and if you frame a right judgment of the ſtate of it, <hi>Neryſa</hi> cannot properly be call'd your Rival; but ſhe is really ſo in intention, though not in effect: and mine are ſo pure and ſo delicate, that even the blind error <hi>Neryſa</hi> cheriſhes in her abuſed thoughts, ſeems to blemiſh and aſperſe them.</p>
               <p>Would to the Gods, it were lawful for the World, ſaid I, moſt beautiful Shepherd (for I would not uſe my ſelf to call her <hi>Phila</hi> in private, for fear of being ſurpriz'd with the miſtake in publick) to pay to your Idea, the homage and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, it owes it, under what form ſoever, it
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:94435:139"/> ſhall deſign to repreſent it ſelf: The exceſs of your fidelity, give me leave, to call my injury; ſince my whole ſtock of love is incapacitated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, to repay one half of the debt, it impoſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; and ſhould <hi>Cupid</hi> Mortgage all his Demains to ſupply my inability, I ſhould ſtill be in arrear to ſo matchleſs a Bounty. Converſe with <hi>Neriſa</hi> with the ſame innocence, you did, before I knew you. And the minutes of bliſs, ſhe will rob me of, ſhall furniſh me with a ſum of vexations, that I beg you to accept in part of payment of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite one, for which I ſtand indebted to you; and as then you ſhall take care not to decline all diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to enjoy my company alone, I ſhall be able to impute a tender reproach to you, that you did not that for me, which I would have done for you. Oh! moſt ingrateful perſon, reply'd the generous <hi>Phila,</hi> Do you think, that thoſe vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which you account to me in part of payment of the debt you boaſt of, will coſt me nothing? Is not your abſence, think you, as inſupportable to <hi>Corydon,</hi> as <hi>Corydon</hi>'s is to you? And do you judge, though the unequal temper of our hearts ſhould not render us both of one weight in thoſe Scales, that the company of <hi>Neriſa</hi> ought to be obtruded on me, for a diverſion? This <hi>Neriſa,</hi> I ſay, who many luſters ago prun'd up with all the advantages and charms of youth, durſt ſcarce pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the title of <hi>Tolerable;</hi> and who at an age; wherein the moſt radiant Beauties ſuffer a total Eclipſe, and become types of uglineſs and horror, imagines Heaven has bleſt her with the ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Gift of enchanting all that look on her. Did you ever behold anything more extravagant, than the Habits and Dreſſes ſhe affects?</p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:94435:140"/>
               <p>I am ready to fancy ſometimes, that thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible things are indu'd with reaſon; and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd of her for depriving them of that right and priviledge, they enjoy in all others, by a malicious kind of artifice increaſe her natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. Are the apiſh toyes and vanities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe endeavors to diſguiſe her decripedneſs; the ſcandalous inclination of her heart, which ready to take leave of the World, and drop into the Urn, cannot yet take leave of youthful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; and that inſatiable rage, which cauſing her to forget the reſpect ſhe owes to the memory of <hi>Pollio,</hi> makes her ſtoop to her own diſgrace, and in the face of the whole World, infamouſly court a poor contemptible Shepherd? Are theſe, I ſay, qualities, to induce me to regard theſe hours, as a pleaſure and diverſion, I ſhould dedicate to the loath'd Amour of <hi>Neriſa?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phila</hi> had ſcarce pronounc'd theſe laſt words, when I thought I heard a noiſe very near us, and indeed it was <hi>Neriſa;</hi> who having liſtn'd to our diſcourſe, and not able any longer to be Miſtreſs of her patience, flung away in a fury; which alarm'd us with the effects of it. I made haſte to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, what it was; but being forc'd to fetch a great circumference round, before I could find a place to look over the Hedge, <hi>Neriſa</hi> had convey'd her ſelf away with ſuch ſpeed, that I could not catch a ſight of her. She ſent that very day for <hi>Melibeus;</hi> and having ſeverely checkt him for a criminal negligence, or conſent, related to him the amorous Dialogue, which had paſt betwixt us. This intelligence did not produce in the ſpirit of <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus</hi> the effect ſhe expected; He knew, I might love <hi>Corydon</hi> without violating the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:94435:140"/> but judging that I could not be inamour'd with the counterfeit Shepheard, but I muſt be made acquainted with the ſecret, which ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd her, and by that means fruſtrate all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he diſpatcht away an Expreſs to advertiſe him of what had happen'd. <hi>Antiochus</hi> made all haſt imaginable to come and ſnatcht his daughter out of the jaws of thoſe imminent diſaſters, which he apprehended her to be threatned with: He arriv'd privately at the houſe of the old Shepheard; and whilſt I was taking a progreſs to <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> whither <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s orders had commanded me, he rob'd me of my felicity, and <hi>Sicily</hi> of its glory, by conveying her out of it. Conſider the deſtruction I was ſeiz'd with, when I was inform'd of this cruel Rape, which <hi>Antiochus</hi> had committed more upon my repoſe, then the inclinations of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I preſently ſent for <hi>Melibeus,</hi> and omitted neither intreaties, nor menaces, to extort a real confeſſion of the truth from him: But he with with an obſtinate loyalty conceall'd the fatal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and making ſeveral ſolemn proteſtations, with a diſſembled frankneſs which deluded me, that he was both innocent, and ignorant of any deſign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to <hi>Phila,</hi> poſſeſt me with a ſtrong appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, that <hi>Neriſa,</hi> had by violence ſecur'd her in ſome place or other. I run to her, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her of her, in terms that neither had reſpect to her Sex nor Quality; and arraigning her luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ardors, and Deſigns, before the Tribunal of her Modeſty and Honor, I rais'd her impatience to the higheſt pitch of fury. She had the ſame jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and ſuſpition of me, as I had of her; and thundring them forth in my ears in vollies of reproaches, as extravagant, as unjuſt, upbraided me with that,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:94435:141"/> which none was able to do, but her ſelf. <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus,</hi> ſaid ſhe, has doubtleſs checkt his Nephew for effecting ſo unnatural a correſpondence with thee, and thou fearing that his ſharp reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould diſſolve that ſhameful Intrigue, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd him away thy ſelf; and in the mean time with an audacity and impudence, which merits the chaſtiſement of the Gods, does charge me with a violence, infinitely more juſtifiable on my ſide, than on thine.</p>
               <p>This erronious frenzie of <hi>Neriſa,</hi> drew ſome ſighs from me; and I had ſuddenly after a freſh ſubject to renew them. <hi>Melibeus</hi> receiv'd intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that <hi>Antiochus</hi> dy'd in his return with his Daughter to <hi>Athens;</hi> and his death having advanc'd on him with ſuch ſpeed and violence, that it allow'd him not the time to write to <hi>Melibeus,</hi> he knew not in what part of the World to begin his ſearch for her. This misfortune triumph't over all the glory of his former diſcretion and prudence; he complain'd of the cruelty of his deſtiny, and made an open declaration of that, he had till then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd with ſo much care, and fidelity. This No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty ſurpriz'd all <hi>Sicily,</hi> and attracted upon me ſo many mournful condolements, that I was not able to ſupport them, whereupon I reſolv'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change that now unpleaſing Climate, for another, that might not recal the memory of <hi>Phila</hi> ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to my thoughts, as the objects would do, that I ſhould behold there.</p>
               <p>I came to <hi>Rome,</hi> where I grew familiar with <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> as I told <hi>Tullia</hi> yeſterday: He was well pleas'd I ſhould come and viſit him in his voluntary Exile, I came one day to ſee him, and being told by his Servants, that he was gone forth to take a walk in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:94435:141"/> that ſame Wood, out of which you ſaw his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and <hi>Terentia</hi> come to receive us, I haſtned thither; and with an eager curioſity, examining all places to find him, I happen'd to caſt an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental glance upon a young Pine-tree, as I paſt by it; and fixing my eye more intentively upon it, I diſcover'd ſome Cyphers engrav'd on the Bark of it, which were, methought, of too youthful and too amorous a character, to intrude themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſolitude of <hi>Cicero.</hi> I read them, and as ſoon as I had found him, I begin now to believe, ſaid I to him, that the reports which fly about <hi>Rome,</hi> have ſomething of truth in them, and that you do not court this Retirement for your Miſtreſs, but in reference to ſome other. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſeem'd to be a little troubled at my Compliment; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently recompoſing himſelf; Theſe are Fables of my Wives invention, ſaid he; who willing to caſt a blemiſh upon the juſt reaſons, I had to repudiate her, alledges a chimerical Amour for the ground and colour of her reproaches. Was it to give a colour to this Fable? anſwered I, ſmiling, that your Wife came hither privately to carve Cyphers upon your Trees, intermixt with croſt Darts, and other Gallantries, which I find ſo ingenuouſly flouriſh'd upon your young Pines? <hi>Cicero</hi> ſeeming to take no notice of what I ſhewed him, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his guilt by a ſudden bluſh; and this ſecond ſurprize, confirming what the firſt had hinted to me, he thought, I believe, that it would be to no purpoſe for his lips to deny that, which his eyes had declared to me already.</p>
               <p>It is not to be deny'd, <hi>Virgil,</hi> ſaid he, with as much tenderneſs as confuſion, that my age, ſtudy, and my vexatious reſentments for the publick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:94435:142"/> have not the power to ſecure from me the invaſions of that paſſion, wherewith you reproach me. Love neither reſpects the gravity of years, nor the juncture of affairs; and as long as we poſſeſs Hearts animated by Life, we ought to fear, that we may be rob'd of them by Love. I repos'd a moſt entire preſumption in the Maxims of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; nor could I believe, that at the years of that diſcretion, werewith the number of them ought to have inſpir'd me, I could have been capable of the wanton flames of Youth. But I find that the Politicks of age, tranſcend thoſe of Eloquence; which cauſes the Soul to participate of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Body: And methought, that in the vigor of my youthful years, I had one of greater courage and proof, than I have now, againſt the attack of that Paſſion.</p>
               <p>I was too ſenſible my ſelf of the power of Love, to wonder at the effects it produc'd in <hi>Cicero.</hi> I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed all the applauſes, he could deſire, to his aged frenſie; and this approbation winning his confidence, he invited me to ſee his Miſtreſs. But, my Lord, how incredible do you think, was my aſtoniſhment, when I ſaw it was the ſame <hi>Phila,</hi> whom I ſo paſſionately affected? The ripeſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or the firmeſt courage would have wanted reſolution to encounter ſuch a ſurprize. I made a loud exclamation, which was able to make a clear diſcovery of my heart. <hi>Phila's</hi> admiration was not inferiour to mine, and <hi>Cicero</hi>'s being as great, as that of either of us both, he gave us the liberty of entertaining one another with a long diſcourſe, not having the power to interrupt us.</p>
               <p>How <hi>Phila?</hi> ſaid I to her; Are you become the abſolute Miſtreſs of your own diſpoſal? Is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longation
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:94435:142"/> of your diſguiſe expir'd? Were you not inform'd I was in <hi>Rome?</hi> Were you ſo near it, and would not ſend to acquaint me with the place of your reſidence? I neither knew of your being in <hi>Rome,</hi> reply'd the fair <hi>Phila;</hi> nor, had I imagin'd it, would it have been poſſible for me to have ſent to you. The reſtraint I am confin'd to will ſcarce ſuffer me to believe, that there is any ſuch place as <hi>Rome</hi> in the World: and you ought to acknowledge that Love has wrought a great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle in your favor, that you have obtained the priviledge of ſeeing me, or ſpeaking to me. It ſhall never work ſuch another, ſince this is ſo little in mine, interrupted <hi>Cicero;</hi> and whereas this firſt intrigue of my confidence, has prov'd ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, I renounce for ever all temptations of expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to a ſecond: And having ſaid this, he made a ſign to an old Woman, who was Guardian over her, to withdraw her into an Arbor, which was near us; and meaſuring the Walks with long and haſty paces, expreſt ſo much grief and vexation in all the motions of his perſon and countenance, that I began to fear ſome funeſt effect of his rage.</p>
               <p>How? <hi>Cicero,</hi> ſaid I, is it you that inveigh with ſuch zeal and violence againſt all invaſions of the publick liberty, and commit one of ſuch horror and barbariſm your ſelf? What preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive can you challenge over this perſon? And by what authority do you pretend to uſurp a right to enſlave her to this unworthy condition? By the authority, which Parents may uſurp over their Children, reply'd <hi>Cicero: Antiochus</hi> dying, with his laſt breath, bequeath'd me all he was ever Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of: and ſince the Prerogative, he has given me over her, is become ſo incompatible with your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:94435:143"/> I adviſe you, as a friend, to uſe your early endeavors to ſuppreſs them. <hi>Phila</hi> is my right only; I receiv'd her as a Legacy from her Father; and that you may not ſuſpect, that I tyrannically uſurp a power, which I have no title to, ſee here, ſaid he, drawing a Paper out of his Pocket, the laſt Will and Deſires of that good man. I read the Writing he put into my hands, and found that <hi>Antiochus,</hi> after he had magnified by many endearing expreſſions, the friendſhip contracted betwixt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and <hi>Cicero,</hi> during his ſojourn in <hi>Athens,</hi> in the time of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Tyranny, declar'd, That he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd wholly to him the tuition and guardianſhip of his only Daughter; advertis'd him where he ſhould find her in <hi>Rome</hi> under the name of <hi>Plautia,</hi> and deſir'd him to take her to Wife, ſince his divorce from his own, gave him the liberty of a ſecond Marriage; or elſe to chooſe a Husband for her, with the ſame freedom and authority, as he ſhould have us'd himſelf, had Heaven conſerv'd his life. Do you judge now, went he on, that whither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what I told you, at the beginning of our converſe, I ſhall not take care to ſee the laſt Will of my dying Friend executed with all fidelity? Can you be ſo vain, to conceive any hopes of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing <hi>Phila</hi> out of my hands, or the power of my deſires? And do you imagine, that if I could have been able to have ſubdu'd them, I would not have done it long ſince for my own conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rather than now for yours.</p>
               <p>I combated the deſign of <hi>Cicero,</hi> with all the vehemency, and all the eloquence, love could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire me with; and not that day only, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more following alſo. I omitted neither intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor arguments to oblige him to reſtore <hi>Phila</hi>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:94435:143"/> to her native liberty, and that of chooſing a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band for her ſelf. Methought, they began to make ſome impreſſion upon his relenting obſtinacy; Great Souls will always at laſt re-aſſume their own character; and the firſt weakneſs, they are capable of, are but, as ſudden ſtorms, which as ſuddenly paſs. But the flight of <hi>Phila</hi> deſtroy'd in a moment all theſe glorious hopes; and though, to do <hi>Cicero</hi> juſtice, I am oblig'd to ſay, that he was ready in favor of my inclinations to impoſe a violence upon his own, yet I muſt likewiſe declare, that he has been the fatal author of all the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and diſcontents, my life has ever ſince been forced to groan under.</p>
               <p>It is not <hi>Cicero</hi> alone, whom you ought to make the ſubject of your accuſations, ſaid <hi>Cornelius,</hi> I am acquainted with all the particulars of <hi>Phila's</hi> flight; and though ſhe always conſerv'd that which concern'd you, as a moſt nice ſecret, from my knowledge, I have ſome cauſe to apprehend, that a Rival who lay conceall'd, has done you more injury, than that which openly profeſſed himſelf to be ſo.</p>
